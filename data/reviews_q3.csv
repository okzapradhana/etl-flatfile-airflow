1497879,21943405,2014-10-27,19785528,Jose Edwin,El apartamento está perfecto. Es tranquilo y está muy cerca de la ciudad y el aeropuerto. Recomendable.
1497879,22093757,2014-10-29,22488375,Kayla,"Sara was beyond nice and very helpful with allowing us to drop off our bags the morning before checkin with a small fee. Her place was clean and very comfortable, perfect for being able to fly out very seems least the next morning. Thank you so much again for our last minute request, the neighborhood was very safe and close to the T. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay here! "
1497879,22229170,2014-11-02,12920446,Tim,"We arrived on Friday night to be met by Sara.  Everything was perfect and Sara gave us the full tour of the apartment.   The apartment was a perfect retreat for us and Sara made us feel at home.  It is exactly as described.   As well, Sara gave us a rundown of the area and some good advice on local restaurants.
In fact, there are many excellent restaurants within minutes (walking) from the apartment and don’t forget to go to Maverick Square for some delicious pastries and coffee.
The apartment is very well situated within minutes of the “T”.
We had no trouble parking our car out front of the apartment and since it was the weekend we did not have to worry too much about moving it."
1497879,22382070,2014-11-04,22359208,Emily,Me and my friend stayed to Sara's apartment only one night. The apartment was amazing and Sara is helpful. She's a really good host and person! Thanks for all! ;)))
1497879,22435243,2014-11-06,22421241,Kori,Great host! Very accommodating to our late night arrival. Perfect location for travel from Boston-Logan airport. Sara provides additional information for the area to enhance your stay. 
1497879,22519460,2014-11-09,13781784,Victoria,"Sara was an awesome host. Unfortunately, I never got the chance to meet her, but she was responsive and very accommodating. The place looks like the pictures and is in an excellent location! She allowed my brother to leave his bags after check out time because he had a later flight. Thanks Sara for an awesome stay!"
1497879,22657673,2014-11-11,19205011,Cynthia,"Sara was very easy to communicate with and responsive over text.  The directions to her apartment were clear and accurate.  The blue line is very close by, and made access to downtown Boston very convenient. The apartment itself was just as advertised: plenty of space, private bathroom, laundry, and kitchenette in the main bedroom closet.  Another great thing about Sara's place: it is right around the corner from beautiful Piers Park, with amazing views of the city, a giant playground for kids, and lots of nice seating to watch the boats go by."
1497879,22825919,2014-11-16,10479323,Alexis,"Sara was a very laid-back person and easy to get along with. She gave great instructions on how to navigate the city. The apartment was in a good area close to the airport and close to the train station. Apartment was a good size, especially for two people. I found it difficult to sleep because there was this annoying dog who would bark for hours in the morning. It was also oddly colder in one room than the rest of the apartment."
1497879,22923346,2014-11-17,18608703,Desiree,Sara was very welcoming! We were thrilled to have a warmed and cozy room awaiting us after a late flight!  It is exactly as described! Very charming! We will definitely seek Sara out for an AirBnB stay for future Boston trips! 
1497879,22982721,2014-11-19,22338674,Xin,Great location both to downtown and the airport! Small but cozy. 
1497879,23202563,2014-11-25,18393676,Amanda,"Sara's place was perfect! It was everything I expected and the street it was on was beautiful! It was in a perfect location, just a short walk to the train station and not even a 5min ride into the heart of Boston. Great place to stay if you are looking for the true Boston feel! "
1497879,23557348,2014-12-04,5641949,Steve,Sara was great!  Her place was clean and easy to find.  The location was very convenient- ~3min from Logan Airport.  She was helpful and helping me find the place- very positive experience!
1497879,23906698,2014-12-14,22457896,Philip,Everything was fine! We didn't meet her personally but due to very good instructions it was very easy to get all things done. Apartment was tidy and everything was ready for us to sleep. We had plenty of room for our group and it was a pleasure to stay in her apartments which was just a couple of metres away from a perfect skyline view.
1497879,24065919,2014-12-18,23131792,Kathy,"Very nice place, comfortable and quiet with everything I needed. The location was perfect for getting to both downtown and the airport. Sara was an awesome host, very helpful."
1497879,24144995,2014-12-21,9405722,Judah,Great 
1497879,24249431,2014-12-23,13364415,Alexandre,"Mise à part Sarah qui a eu un contre temps et ne pouvais nous accueillir  avant 8:PM, Sarah et le logement était parfait, excellente location, parking possible de 17h jusque 10h du matin, proche d'un parc avec la meilleurs vue sur downtown Boston. Je recommande!

Except that Sarah was not ready until 8PM due to her work, everything was perfect, she was really nice and helpful then the location was really nice with lot of parkings facilities. we greatly recommend her for your visitation in Boston !"
1497879,24789782,2015-01-02,19593921,Juan,"The experience was great: close to the subway, spacious, clean! The place was very well organized and the host was quick to respond"
1497879,25184528,2015-01-08,13281970,Judy,"Sara let me in and showed me around my little home for the next 3 days.  She was a gracious hostess.  Everything was spic and span and nicely decorated.  Bed very comfortable and amenities plentiful.  Loved the tiny ""kitchen"" in the closet. Neighborhood was great from the amazing view of Boston skyline from Pier's Park to the great coffee and breakfast sandwiches at Boston Brewin just a few blocks away at 154 Maverick.  And very quiet.  Maverick station a short walk and therefore easy to get to Boston or the airport.  I highly recommend it."
1497879,25289976,2015-01-11,25472496,Jillian,"Sara was a wonderful host. She was full of information about the area. The place was great! Lots of space and very close to the T subway station. Also, Sara has provided many perks such as a coffee, toiletries, DVD player with movies, etc. (Good Will Hunting was perfect for our Boston trip!). I highly recommend staying at her location if you are looking for a homey, private place to stay. 

Sara - Thank you again for the great hospitality! "
1497879,25661317,2015-01-22,17488967,Francisco,Very nice and clean place. We had a really good stay at Sara's apartment.
1497879,25734150,2015-01-24,3606549,Yosuke,"Sara's place was great! She has everything you'll need. She even created a guest binder with lots of useful info. I recommend staying at her place to anyone. So close to the airport, too."
1497879,25780475,2015-01-25,26545437,Allyson,"Sara was an excellent host. She provided great instructions for how to check in and check out, making it a breeze. She was very welcoming with an informative binder providing tips for how to enjoy the city! The apartment is as it appears in the pictures, very neat and tidy. There were two of us and Sara had a separate bed set up and ready for us when we arrived. The neighbourhood also felt safe and was extremely convenient for hopping on the T to the downtown core, or to the airport stop on the Blue line to catch the free shuttle to our terminal."
1497879,26077353,2015-02-02,26178900,Judy,Sara was extremely accommodating and made this a very positive first experience with airbnb. She graciously answered my many questions. The bed was very comfortable and the location was excellent for going to and from the airport as well as downtown.
1497879,26123797,2015-02-03,8349172,Kelly,Great access to the airport.  Our flight was delayed a day Sara's place was cozy and a good place to hunker down in a snow storm. It is a basement apt. but has nice personal touch.  Appreciate the coffee and oatmeal etc. We would stay again. Thank you Sarah!
1497879,26587495,2015-02-16,11860109,Paul,"made to feel really welcome,and was given full information about the apartment and area. it was a shame that there was so much snow with more expected so couldn't appreciate the area. It was close to the MBTA so could get to downtown and back to the airport very easily. very comfortable apartment, with coffee machine microwave and fridge. great italian restaurant round the corner. thank you sara for a great visit thanks also for the comprehensive visitor folder"
1497879,26767711,2015-02-18,21267240,Molly,"Very comfortable apartment, exactly as described. The bed is super comfy, lots of warm blankets and a really nice mattress.
Sara was very easy to communicate with, very responsive by email & by phone. We were there for 2 days - checking in and out was very easy. Great neighborhood, very close to Maverick Sq"
1497879,26807943,2015-02-19,26295233,Yutao,"Sara was super accommodating and helpful. Our flight was delayed and she made sure everything was OK and waited until we got there safe and sound. She gave us lots of useful tips on the neighborhood and tours around Boston.

The place was just a few minutes walk to the T. The rooms are clean and warm. Sara even prepared 2 electric heaters for us just in case the apartment heating wasn't enough.

Thanks Sara! I would definitely stay there again.
"
1497879,27205192,2015-02-28,6720024,John,"Sara's downstairs apartment was great for my 3 day visit. It's very clean and the bed was perfect. Quiet apt and quiet neighborhood. The walk to Maverick Sq for the T was indeed 5 min max. Visitors should note that the Maverick T stop is only one stop from Logan airport, so you can't get more convenient than that. Sara was available to help whenever I had a question and was responsive to all my messages. Overall, an A+ experience for me."
1497879,27421441,2015-03-03,8987150,Jet,"We needed a place to stay in east Boston on very short notice. Sara responded to my request within 20 minutes and made the effort to arrange the check-inn that evening, thanks Sara! The apartment was nice and big and included everything we needed. It was very cold and the heating was not working properly, but Sara made sure we would not get cold. She put Spaceheaters in the room and extra sheets on the bed.
We enjoyed our stay!
"
1497879,27436310,2015-03-04,1159255,Ellen,Room was as pictured and Sara is easy to deal with.
1497879,27644420,2015-03-09,3949036,Megan,Sara was GREAT! We arrived a little earlier than expected but she was super accommodating! Her place is really cute and we were very thankful for the spare toothbrush she had out! We had totally forgotten ours at the last place! Thanks again!
1497879,27931376,2015-03-15,18456186,Raymund,"Sara was a great host. She is very clear when giving instructions which made the process very smooth. She definitely seems like an experienced host.

Her apartment is much larger than i expected and can very comfortably fit 4 people.  It's also right by the maverick train station making it very easy to get around boston."
1497879,28099665,2015-03-17,21890712,Jordan,"Highly recommend! Unfortunately we weren't able to meet Sara personally, but she was an excellent host! Her apartment was very nice, SUPER close to the Blue Line, and very well maintained! She was very communicative and helpful with us."
1497879,28148401,2015-03-18,21323945,Denise,"Sara's place was cute, comfortable and super convenient. Just the right spot to stay close to everything in Boston for St. Patrick's Day. She wasn't there when we arrived, but made sure we could access the apartment via lock box. We had a great time!  "
1497879,28298706,2015-03-22,10262635,Christina,Great stay! Sara was so nice and had everything ready for us. The bed and futon were both comfy enough. This locations proximity to the train station was perfect for us. No trouble parking in this neighborhood either. I would definitely come back. Thank you!
1497879,28596989,2015-03-27,24057538,Cihan,"The description in the advertisement was excellent. Sara's instructions, the very useful manual she prepared for us, the coziness of the apartment and the many many amenities made us feel home. The neighborhood is clean, safe and quite. The metro is just three minutes away. Downtown Boston is just 10-15 mins away. The airport is also very close by (15 to 30 mins in total). Great experience! I very much recommend this apartment!"
1497879,29073663,2015-04-03,29939557,David,"Sara was great...showed us around the apt as soon as we arrived. Everything looked like the pictures...very nice.  Comfortable, and with lots of nice little extras. My only complaints are minor. The wi-fi had some problems and cut off at times. Also, because we were there on a Thursday when they do street cleaning I had to get up very early to move my car and it took quite awhile to find a spot. This is not under Sara's control of course. Overall, a very nice experience!"
1497879,29528982,2015-04-08,30354275,Lee,"I had a pretty crazy (and ever-changing) schedule but Sara was flexible and made it easy to coordinate! The place was clean, quiet, and exactly as described. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to explore the neighborhood so can't speak much to that. "
1497879,29574814,2015-04-09,666809,Tanya,"Sara was great. Very accommodating and responsive. The apartment is located quite close to the subway, making it easy to get around."
1497879,29993686,2015-04-15,25249144,Yasmine,"This place was really great! My friends and I had a great night of sleep there, it's quiet and confortable! Sara is very nice and carefull"
1497879,30078553,2015-04-17,12528117,Cris,"Sara was a good communicator, making our visit easy and fun. Excellent directions to get there by foot, told us of late night pizza place 5 mins away, she even hauled my huge heavy bag up the stairs before I could stop her. Clean and comfy room."
1497879,30533377,2015-04-23,31421397,Andres,"The apartment was very clean, all was like the description said, the apartment has a comple stuff... the only problem is that the internet connection some times is very slow and there was a leak in the bathroom."
1497879,30573353,2015-04-24,5962862,Mary,"Pros: Sara is prompt, responsive, polite and helpful, especially for a short notice request. The location is great, close to the T and the airport, in a safe neighborhood.  The description is spot on, but the furniture is in a slightly different arrangement from the photos.  The guest information book and the takeout menus were a lifesaver, as my husband and I arrived (easily by Uber from the airport) past 1am and were starving! (The Chinese Dragon delivered exactly on time and was pretty tasty.)  The ""kitchen closet"" had flatware that the restaurant forgot to give us.  There's an extra sitting room with a futon and a basket with a ton of helpful tourist information.  We loved watching Netflix on the Roku while eating our late dinner.  Sara has a fun, eclectic variety of DVDs to choose from, too.  She provided us clean towels.  She leaves really easy, clear directions for everything, from checking in and out to switching the TV between Roku and DVD modes.  All these little details make you feel like you're in a friend's home.

Cons: When we finally settled in for bed around 3am, we pulled back the fluffy comforter to discover what looked like old sheets.  They looked like they'd been washed, but were severely pilled and discolored in some areas.  We ended up sleeping on top of the flat sheet, which looked clean and more crisp.  The room is chilly (which is probably great in the summer!).  We were provided an effective space heater but it was a bit loud, so it woke me a few times when it switched on throughout the night.

Thank you for hosting us on such short notice and providing such spot on information for our first airbnb experience!"
1497879,30668046,2015-04-26,21955507,Nicole,Sara was great to communicate with. Her place is as pictured. It is close to the airport and was great for a stopover. The stairs down are not the ones pictured however they are tight with suitcases. 
1497879,31311950,2015-05-04,28878250,Paul,"As long as you plan to use the public transport this location could not be better. Close to airport but no noise from it, just two stops from central Boston, was perfect for us as we were out all day. However, if you plan to spend a lot of time where you stay this may not be for you as it is a basement, no openable window, strong smell of cat ( we own and love cats but this was a little strong for us). That said Boston is very expensive and this room reasonably priced for Boston. Kitchen area is microwave and kettle. Washer and drier we did not use but look impressive. If room had been cleaner and without cat smell would of given a 4 star review."
1497879,31499846,2015-05-05,5960468,Dan,"I had planned on short 2 day notice(with +2 guests) to reserve a spot in Sara's AirBnB. Her place was very clean and cozy. She did a professional job in having amenities such as laundry, TV,  toaster/microwave, and plenty of guides for Boston. 

I'd recommend coming back to stay here if you want an affordable yet comfortable stay in the city of Boston. "
1497879,31628704,2015-05-08,13433107,Liz,"We didn't get a chance to meet Sara, but her directions and communications were great. We arrived and were able to access the room with no trouble at all.
The room and bathroom were just as described and allowed us a fantastic stay in Boston.  Very comfortable bed and the room was nicely decorated.
3 min walk to T and so convenient to city centre ( 2 stops to State) but also very convenient for airport (just one stop away by T) 
All in all a brilliant stay!"
1497879,31803554,2015-05-10,28193329,Elham,We enjoyed the proximity of the studio to the Boston Logan airport.  We had an extremely early flight and the taxi ride to the airport was only $10.  The studio worked well for what we needed.  We were only there for the night before our flight.  Sara left us with a very organized binder with everything from internet instructions to local eateries and taxi phone numbers.  She gave us a tour of the studio and was very helpful.
1497879,32200227,2015-05-15,9890602,Andrew,"
My wife and I were in Boston for 2 days/1 night before heading to Cape Cod for the weekend. We chose to stay at Sarah's apartment in East Boston because it was a perfect location for us in terms of closeness to the airport/car rental (for out-of-town transit) and to the T (for local transit)! Sarah was extremely accommodating and accessible, and the apartment was a fine size for 2 people.
Bottom line: we would stay again!
"
1497879,32452445,2015-05-18,26596565,Pam,Great location! An easy walk to the T and one stop to the airport or in the other direction many attractions only 1 or a few stops away. Worked perfectly for my agenda. I couldn't have asked for a better spot. Sara made everything simple; from key pickup to my morning cup of coffee each day.  I only issue I had was with my Verizon cell service but since I didn't spend much time in the room and  the internet worked just fine this didn't cause me any worries. I will try to stay here again the next time I am in Boston.
1497879,32503601,2015-05-19,28626807,Angel,Sara es muy amable. Nos dio todas las indicaciones necesarias y estuvo atenta a nuestra llegada
1497879,32683709,2015-05-20,2039835,Scott,"Sara was welcoming and helpful to us. The neighborhood is safe and quiet. We would stay here again and we recommend it to others.
"
1497879,32791384,2015-05-21,26491112,James,"The room was clean and spacious and well appointed with convenience items like soap etc, as well as coffee/tea. I found the bed to be very comfortable. Sara was excellent in communicating to arrange access, and the location is on a nice quite street. It provided exactly what I was hoping for - a nice/clean place to sleep while in town for business without having to spend $350 for a hotel room. "
1497879,33131666,2015-05-25,32026367,Michelle,"Sara was extremely informative. When we arrived she showed us the place and made sure we understood how all of the amenities worked. Overall, the place was tidy and homey. Thanks for everything Sara!"
1497879,33953069,2015-06-02,28478855,Adelita,It was nice. Great location! Thanks Sarah!
1497879,34295262,2015-06-07,29597672,Alicia,The apartment was clean and in a great location.  Sara was a great host!  
1497879,34766091,2015-06-12,22851352,Sandra,The apartment looked like in the pictures and was fully equipped. We only stayed one night but the bed was really comfortable we slept great! The communication was perfect and fast and Sara held our bags for late check out. Perfect for our short stay
1497879,35072223,2015-06-15,28643509,Chelsie,Sara was great! We arrived later in the night due to the Red Sox game and she was able to let us in and show us around. Everything is exactly how it was advertised. Thank you again!
1497879,35249802,2015-06-16,2621548,Jill,"The studio was in the basement and it was not bad.  Limited sunlight due to it being in the basement. There was a small, worn loveseat and a small tv.  Small makeshift kitchenette area with coffee. There are somewhat steep stairs down so keep that in mind.  It was sufficient for our needs for one night. "
1497879,35552479,2015-06-20,455516,Kasey,Sara is such a great hostess! She provided so many pointers for what to do in the area and how to get around. Her apartment is very close to the subway and several little gems in her neighborhood. (Italian express pizzeria...go here you won't regret it). It's also just a short walk for a fabulous view of the downtown area and the harbor! Thank you so much for your hospitality Sara!! :)
1497879,35939023,2015-06-23,21560083,Sequoia,"Sara was very accommodating to our arrival/need to leave our bags early. The room was clean and well stocked with supplies, and the bed was comfortable. "
1497879,36677954,2015-06-30,32588853,Sam,"I had a great stay at Sara's place. Sara was accommodating and good with communication. She also has really detailed directions in her house manual which saved me a bit of money as I ended up using the T instead of a taxi. I've stayed in a few airbnb properties before Sara's and she was the only one to have a folder full of useful information (transport,  tourist sites,  food, etc) and it was much appreciated. I used the tourist info to fill my spare day.

The bed is also really comfy and I slept really well. Having Netflix is also a bonus for night time."
1497879,37023520,2015-07-03,37189420,Sara,"Sara was very nice and accommodating! The studio was clean and well kept, with all needed amenities."
1497879,37842258,2015-07-11,9798334,Beate,"Although I did not even meet Sarah, everything worked out perfectly. Thanks for the nice and very convenient stay!"
1497879,38593202,2015-07-17,13506008,Gulbin,"Our host was a nice person, just beware its a basement and is prone to the issues a basement can have."
1497879,38702414,2015-07-18,3826813,Laura,"I felt very welcome (Sara is a sweet host) and description of the room fit well with the place (do notice that it is a basement room). Neighborhood was nice and safe, though not a lot of restaurants or cafés. you may have a nice walk to the water side where one can watch Boston centre from a distance across the water - very nice :)"
1497879,38838229,2015-07-19,3031085,Sebastian,"I was looking for a place to stay in between a flight into Boston and a bus trip the following day. Sara's place is conveniently located, a short walk from the Maverick T station on the Blue Line. 
Check-in was uncomplicated; we connected via texting. The studio itself is a basement space with little natural light. It is otherwise as described - no frills, but it did the trick for my needs.
The bed was comfortable, the couch was aging, and something in the space triggered my allergies. No idea if it was cat hair, mold, or something completely different, but my eyes were watering and my nose stuffed up. I think around 5 am, the batteries of a smoke detector  in an adjacent room started failing, so I got a nice chirp for the rest of my night. It was also quite warm, but Sara provided a big box fan that cooled things down.
Overall, the experience was more or less what I expected and what I needed, since I was not looking for a luxury hotel."
1497879,39395495,2015-07-23,21042928,Victoria,"Sara was very quick to answer any of my emails or questions and although she couldn’t be there to meet us with the keys, she texted all the details in advance so we could easily get in and out. The place is located in a great neighbourhood, super close to the subway which took us right downtown. Unfortunately, although the air bnb was cute - I’m not sure if there was a flooding recently or what, but the air had a very strong smell of mold. There was an air purifier, but it didn’t feel like it did much and was just really loud throughout the night. We also couldn’t use the bedding because when we lifted the sheets, it was full of hair and chip crumbs…. so we slept on our sleeping bags on the bed….. Otherwise, Sara did stock the place with coffee, toiletries, towels and even tourist information about the city which was a very cute touch. "
1497879,39625293,2015-07-25,34310612,Ruthie,"Our hostess, Sara made us feel welcome, and the location was nice, only one T stop to the Airport and one T stop to Long Wharf. The ""Welcome Book"" had very useful information. But we were disappointed in several factors of the space.
"
1497879,39912815,2015-07-27,25765085,Sara,"Location was very convenient: quiet street, close to a beautiful park with wonderful view of downtown Boston, and close to the subway station. The room was as advertised, quite large and with all amenities (+lots of tourist info). It's in the basement, so not a lot of light, and a bit damp+ feels like a basement= the drier was on when we arrived, plus there was a recycling bin full of empty bottles, and everything wasn't perfectly clean, but still alright all in all (and you can do laundry easily, so there's that). Free street parking on the WE. "
1497879,40118635,2015-07-28,36384332,Bronz,Great Studio near the airport. Great views of the city just 2-3 blocks down the road and lots of stuff to walk to. Sara has done a great job putting a binder full of helpful ideas to help you settle in. 
1497879,40231237,2015-07-29,26596675,Anne,We had a pleasant time in Sara`s apartment! Anytime again.
1497879,42120920,2015-08-11,31195205,Mai,Sara was a fantastic host. Very helpful and gave us a folder of places to eat/go. Lots of travel guides for Boston and other places in the USA in the apartment which was helpful. Description was accurate. Tv had netflix. Very close to the T and the airport. Unfortunately our only complaint was that the apartment smelled like urine. We couldn't find where the smell was coming from but it was strongest around the sofa which was a bit off putting. 
1497879,42306001,2015-08-12,38783532,Billy,Sara was great and very welcoming. Had everything prepared and ready for check in and her overview and booklet provided answers to any and all questions I had.
1497879,42388112,2015-08-13,24639370,Lorette,"Host was easy to contact, very nice and provided clear instructions/directions. Loved the welcome packet and the Keurig coffee maker. Space was cute and exactly as pictured, except there were no warning pics of the extremely narrow and deep staircase down to the apartment. I wasn't sure I was going to get my 40lb, 25"" spinner down and back up without falling and breaking my neck. Upon entering there was a faint odor as if a litter box needed cleaning, but after being there a short time I didn't notice it anymore. The major problem was the heat (I was there in August). I knew there was no A/C but apparently there was no ventilation either. There was a de-humidifier and a large fan that was so loud I couldn't hear the TV, but it only blew the hot air around. The place was like a sauna; I didn't stop sweating the entire time I was there. I stayed one night, couldn't sleep because it was so hot, and got out of there as soon as I could the next morning."
1497879,42667138,2015-08-15,15698541,Joshua,"I needed an affordable place to crash for one night in Boston near the airport and Sara's basement apartment worked out well.  It's great if you don't need anything to fancy and wanna save some money, close to the T line, and very close to the airport.  "
1497879,43052166,2015-08-17,1177749,Jim,Sara was very responsive in making arrangements for the stay. The apartment is very convenient to the airport (one blue line stop away or a $8 taxi ride). There is plenty of room and a fan kept the place cool on a very hot day.
1497879,43483674,2015-08-20,30692226,Marion,"Sara was very easy to correspond with and made us feel very welcome. Her studio was in a perfect location, a lovely quiet area, easy to reach from the airport and a few minutes away from the waterfront where there are fantastic views of the Boston skyline. It is extremely quick and easy to reach downtown Boston on the subway. There are eating places a short walk away. We really liked the area, enjoyed our stay and would use Sara's studio again! Thank you Sara."
1497879,44104714,2015-08-24,6638642,Tiffany,"Sara was a very welcoming host and provided a tour of the space upon our arrival. This place is great if you are on a budget, but not the most comfortable during the summer since there is no AC. Like others had mentioned, there noticeable smell upon entering the apartment, probably due to the lack of ventilation in the space. A fan was provided, but it was an old fan that was so loud, that it was impossible to watch netflix and have the fan on at the same time. Additionally, the  roku to play netflix was an old system, so you can't even watch with subtitles on."
1497879,44385663,2015-08-25,18707046,Jia Ning,"Sara is a good host. At first we entered a wrong address and lost our way, she texted the correct one. The WELCOME book is very helpful and there are lots of tourist info in the room. It's in basement and the signal is not good. Plus the fridge is not very clean. "
1497879,44637099,2015-08-28,33357557,Olivia,Sara was very responsive and answered any questions we had leading up to our stay. The apartment is in a nice area and close to the Maverick T station. The room was comfortable and we were provided with all necessary appliances. Would definitely recommend.
1497879,45064957,2015-08-31,12489857,Jesper,The place was nice and clean and everything worked out very well. Sara has made a nice folder with all the basic and practical information which is helpful. Quick and easy access to Boston with the T from Maverick and the best skyline views from Piers Park around the corner from the apartment.
1497879,45264512,2015-09-01,633918,Fabrizio,"Sara has been very kind to accept us in late evening and show us all the apt commodities. The apt is comfortable and in a great position for the airport, also in a walk distance for Pier Park in which enjoy an awesome skyline of Boston.
Thanks Sara!"
1497879,45495244,2015-09-03,6414748,Tiffanny,Host and family are very friendly and accommodating. Exactly as described. 
1497879,45990030,2015-09-07,38097423,Annie,"The host is a nice lady. But the room is in the basement and the bed is a twin size, no private parking. Need to use fans so the room is hot (no air conditioner) and noisy. We can hardly sleep during the night. The bed material is bad make it even warmer."
1497879,46166583,2015-09-08,231867,Marwan,"I didn't have the chance to see Sarah, I was communicating with her via email and sms and she was responding very quick to my questions, her mother was very welcoming despite the fact that I arrived 3 hrs late and after midnight!! Great place, includes every thing you need for either a long or short stay, I would definitely recommend this place.  "
1497879,46300218,2015-09-09,24173798,윤경,"It was really cozy! and also her mother Susan was very nice!!
If there was air conditioner it would be better :)
But it was good !!!"
1497879,46720702,2015-09-13,11703657,Pablo,"Sara was not there, but his mother help us very well she explained us very well all the house rules and we really liked that "
1497879,46893010,2015-09-14,39267093,Andrea,The apartment is something like a basement. Very hot and with a unique little window. Good position near main street. 
1497879,47171957,2015-09-16,1274685,Pierre,Our stay at Sara's place was very enjoyable. We felt great staying there. The appartment is located close to downtown Boston (couple subway stops) and very close to the airport. Thanks to Sara and her Mom.
1497879,47359077,2015-09-18,8267,Erin,"This host is very organized and accommodating. She walked us through her book of things to do and went out of her way to meet us at the door even when our flight was delayed late into the night.  The room is in the basement and unfortunately, does smell a bit of cat pee. Once the window is open, it helps air flow. "
1497879,47971498,2015-09-22,10193704,Mirela,"I recommend Sara's place. Very close to the T-line which can bring you basically everywhere in Boston. The place and the neighborhood are ok, we felt safe at all times. 
Sara responded very quickly to our queries and she even helped us get to the airport.
All in all, it was a pleasant experience."
1497879,48077570,2015-09-23,6458686,Brian,"Had a great time at Sara's for our overnighter in Boston.  Although the place has some steep stairs in and out, the apartment is quite cozy and fully stocked.  The location is great, with markets, restaurants, and the train station just minutes away.  The neighborhood is safe and makes for a great walk, with the waterfront and spectacular views of downtown just around the corner.  Sara herself is amazing.  She was full of suggestions on what to do around Boston, including lots of free stuff only the locals know about!  We will definitely consider her place again the next time we are in Boston!"
1497879,48278322,2015-09-25,3998427,Kathleen,"Although never met Sara in person since we were in town only briefly overnight and our schedules did not jive,  Sara made it very easy to get in and out.  She promptly made excellent suggestions for dinner as requested.  She answered all our questions and requests thoroughly and has the most complete and helpful house manual we have ever seen in our Airbnb experience worldwide.  Her place is incredibly convenient between airport and downtown just minutes away from the ""T"", Boston's subway, which we utilized with her helpful instructions and saved us lots of time and money."
1497879,48698096,2015-09-28,38343162,Qing,"Sara's apartment is a very cozy place when we come back after go sightseeing outside all day. There are all facilities including microwave oven, coffee machine, fridge which make our stay comfortable. "
1497879,48878470,2015-09-29,38343162,Qing,"Sara's home is near the metro station, about 5-8 minutes walk. And it is safe at night.There's only a few stations you can reach downtown. Meanwhile it is near the Logan airport, this is very convenient  for us. Sara is a very kind girl, she helped me to carry my luggage downstairs into the room, and gave us a detail introduction and information. It seems she has a very cute dog :)"
1497879,49030832,2015-09-30,27758360,Joshua,"The studio apartment was perfect for our overnight stop over in Boston.  We were coming off of an international flight, and had a very early connection the next morning, and this apartment is minutes from the airport.  It saved us the worry of having to rent a car for nine hours, and from having to try and figure how to maneuver around a strange city.  
Sara was very quick at returning all communication about checking in, and when we arrived at the apartment she greeted us and showed us around.  I was super impressed with what she had put together...she has everything you could need to enjoy your stay all in one binder, organized with house rules, local attractions, maps, and menus to restaurants in the area.  
The studio is exactly what you see in the photos.  It is a basement apartment in an old historic building, super cute, and very different from the single story ranch houses that we have in Texas.  The stairs were steep, so watch your step when you enter, but the bed was comfortable, the shower was hot, and there was coffee.  I would stay here if we were spending more time in Boston!
All in all we had a very positive experience in the studio.  "
1497879,49319476,2015-10-03,38739060,Franziska,"Sarah war nett und hat uns freundlich empfangen. Ebenso hat sie sich grosse Mühe gegeben, viele Infos zu sammeln und ihren Gästen einen tollen Überblick über die Gegend zu verschaffen. Leider war anhand des Inserates nicht ersichtlich, dass das Zimmer im Untergeschoss ist und über keine Fenster verfügt. Die sehr steile und enge Treppe dort hinunter fand ich beängstigend. Ebenfalls könnte man in Sachen Hygiene und Sauberkeit noch einiges verbessern. "
1497879,49825735,2015-10-06,44034142,Tracy,The location was convenient to the airport and North End for our quick overnight stay in Boston.  Sara was accommodating an also had excellent communication.  The room was comfortable. We utilized the bed and also the pull out sofa.  We let Sara know of the sleeping arrangements and she had the sofa made into a bed upon arrival.  If her schedule allows she will take you to the airport for a small fee.  An excellent value in a fabulous city.  
1497879,49978061,2015-10-08,36978343,Antish,"Pros:
1. Well located - a few stops from downtown and attractions in Boston
2. Sara is well prepared and the room has everything you need

Cons:
1. Room smells of moisture very badly and we had to buy air freshner to be able to stay there
2. There were flies in the room, i killed 3
3. The room was tidy but thrre was dust on the furniture
4. The shower had very low water pressure"
1497879,50168769,2015-10-10,34789589,Kazue,"サラは忙しい中でも出来るだけの事をして、私の滞在を快適なものにしてくれました。問い合わせに対する返答ものに早く、また、テレビの不具合もすぐに対応してくれました。サラの物件は空港から1駅、ダウンタウンからも数駅で非常に交通の便が良いので短期間の滞在の方にお勧めします。
Sara is very helpful to make my stay as much as comfortable, although her busy schedule. She also responded my inquiries swiftly. When I asked about tv technical issues, she came down and fixed it. 
Her place is very convenient when you come from Logan. It's also close to downtown. "
1497879,50746669,2015-10-14,20619654,Natasha,"Close proximity to the airport, this place was cozy. Sara was great in getting back to me quickly. "
1497879,50920961,2015-10-16,26048719,Kathy,"The listing description, photos are all accurate. The studio was clean and cozy. Sara is wonderful as a host. She gave me details on how to reach the keys. A green book that has everything you need to know to get your TV, wifi, keys, groceries, getting to know Boston and etc to work (I can tell she put a lot of hard work in this!). My family had a long flight coming to Boston and they had a great stay for sure. It was wonderful how this place was close to the airport and she could even take my family to the airport the next morning due to their early flight for a great price. The neighborhood is quiet and this place is a 5-8 min walk from the Maverick station. "
1497879,51117909,2015-10-18,24799376,Alex,"This apartment worked out perfectly for our short stay in Boston. Really close to the airport and the T station, which made it easy to get everywhere that we wanted to. Sara was very easy to get a hold of, and check-in/check-out was a breeze. She even gave us a ride to the airport at 4:30 in the morning! Would recommend this place highly to anyone."
1497879,51533234,2015-10-21,39485837,Richard,"Sara’s apartment was in a great location, close to both the airport and the city by metro. In fact, if you’re game, you don’t even need to catch the metro to the airport, you can just walk 15 mins to where the metro-airport shuttle bus stop is. We didn’t meet Sara, but by phone she was really friendly and responsive. She also had a book in the apartment with great suggestions for free/cheap things to do in Boston, and places to go for $1 oysters! There is a small TV with Netflix, which was good to have after a long day out in Boston.

The studio itself was nice, the pictures represent it well. My only criticism is that because it is a basement, there is a bit of a musty smell – but you get used to the smell pretty quickly, and it clears out once you let some air in, so this didn’t diminish our enjoyment of the apartment.

Overall we had a great stay in Boston and I would definitely recommend staying here.
"
1497879,52211855,2015-10-27,10604919,Kepa,"Despite the good location and the attractions and facilities offered by Sara our arrival, my assessment is negative given that there is a strong urine smell of cat, in the room, impossible to remove and which makes the stay very unpleasant (reading other reviews it seems coming from far away not to take solutions)Definitely it would not repeat the stay"
1497879,52396751,2015-10-29,40233816,Lori,"Even though the location was convenient we would not stay here again. Sara was good at communicating but she was not prepared for us.  We had issues with the following: the odor was unbearable, the shower had very little pressure, tv channels did not work, the stairs need cleaning and the linens had hair on them even though they were clean. "
1497879,52678827,2015-11-01,39819137,Bonnie,"My parents and I stayed at Sara's listing for 3 nights during our visit to Boston. It was nice to be away from the bustle of downtown Boston, but also be super convenient to the T and only two short stops away from attractions like Faneuil Hall, Boston Common, etc. & one stop from the airport. Sara's place is super cute and in a good area - we got back to the room late a couple of nights and never felt unsafe on the walk back from the T station. The stairs are a little steep as the room is in the basement, but as long as you pay attention that shouldn't be an issue. Also, the weather was perfect when we were there so AC wasn't necessary, but I could see the room getting warm in the summer months. Overall, we were very comfortable & would stay here again. (Never got a chance to meet Sara as I don't think our schedules jived on this trip, but she was very accommodating, allowing us to check in early since our flight landed before 2.) "
1497879,53252770,2015-11-07,9796013,Ronald & Denise,"Sara greeted me upon arrival and showed me around the studio apartment which is as pictured. Note that there are steep steps since it is a basement apartment.   She provides a Keurig, Coffee, mini fridge   and microwave also a book with restaurants and points of interest in the area.   This listing was perfect for my needs  as I was traveling alone for business and only needed a stay for 1 night.  I was leaving from Logan and this listing is very close to the airport. The shower and room were clean and I felt safe in the neighborhood walking to get dinner and would recommend this listing for a short stay.  Parking was a challenge however I was able to get a spot around the corner from the listing. The train and restaurants are within walking distance.
"
1497879,53675484,2015-11-11,201908,Marcus,"Pros:
-Close to airport and downtown, short walk to Maverick Square and Blue Line.
-Check-in was fine, no delays or issues.
-Laundry available (if you'll be staying for awhile).
-DVD player with 19"" flat screen. She has several DVDs in the dresser below.
-K-cup machine, kettle, tea.
-Fair number of toiletries available if you need them.
-Water for shower/washing was hot.
-Wireless internet was reliable.

Cons:
-Basement apartment, not much light or air circulation.
-To be honest, the apartment wasn't clean. At all. It was clear to me that she basically changes the sheets on the bed and that's about it.
-Netflix worked intermittently. Because it frequently stalled, it wasn't really usable. Watching DVDs was fine, however.
-Water pressure in shower was pretty weak. It's going to take you a little longer to wash all the suds off your body.
-Bath towels were damp upon arrival.
-Fold-out bed in loveseat was not clean, so we decided not to use it.

The greatest advantage of staying here is the location. However, the space did not feel welcoming and frankly was a little disgusting. This apartment is really best for those who need or desire to be close to both downtown and the airport and do not plan on spending much time at the apartment, using it only as a place to sleep. If you enjoy relaxing at the end of your day in your room/apartment or want to do any of your own cooking, I'd avoid this listing. Sara was thorough in her orientation and made check-in easy, but we did not see her for the rest of our stay. She also avoided making eye contact with us during check-in (perhaps just a nervous habit). This did not bother us in any way, but if you are the kind of guest who enjoys/desires interaction with your host, this probably isn't the place for you. "
1497879,53795916,2015-11-12,25250152,Phil,"We only stayed for one night but the flat was well organised, Sara gave us a good introduction and we found everything we needed including coffee for the morning. The bed was comfortable and the location was great."
1497879,54116997,2015-11-16,16429513,Hailey,"Sara's apartment was in a great location (quick travel to the airport and to downtown Boston). The space looks exactly like the pictures. We had a bit of a fly problem and I wish the Internet connection was a bit better, but other than that it served its purpose. "
1497879,54259358,2015-11-17,22393979,Maxim,The apartment was just like at photos. It was well equipped and Sara did everything to help me feel me welcome.
1497879,54696559,2015-11-23,4292843,Kenneth,"First 2 days had a crazy amount of bugs, but she was very nice about it and helped out. Initial room had an interesting smell, but you dont notice after a while. Checking in should be very easy!"
1497879,54889142,2015-11-25,545823,Noah,Sara was very accommodating and met me at the door. The room was exactly as expected and quite comfortable. It was also very close to mass transit which made things very easy. I would recommend Sara to anyone.
1497879,55043158,2015-11-27,35969063,Yiding,Great place to stay in ! It offers a great location as well as a very clean and tidy studio. RECOMMENDED !
1497879,55202543,2015-11-29,3616229,AnhThu,Had a great stay and everything was just as described. Sara was really helpful in answering all our questions. The best thing about the apartment is its close proximity to the subway that made getting around the city really easy.
1497879,55597838,2015-12-02,41219518,Sean,Sara was a great host and the apartment was amazing and in a good location. Would definitely stay here again!!
1497879,55933311,2015-12-07,47516996,Jing,"Overall, its a pretty nice apartment with almost everything you need.If only the bathroom is better equipped..."
1497879,56095968,2015-12-08,40941541,Alex,"Sara was helpful and accommodating. The room is cozy. 
It is also in the basement, with a tiny window that  onto the sidewalk. 
Don't open the window, no fresh air. 

When I arrived, the thermostat read 76 degrees.I turned it down, and went out for dinner. Several hours later, the room was still 76 degrees. I called Sara to help me with the temperature, as the thermostat was not working. Bottom line: shut the heat off, on a Boston winter night.

Next morning, the shower was miserable. A sorry little stream of water, no pressure whatsoever. Temperature was hot, but it was a very unsatisfactory way to start the day.

This room could be a great situation but for those issues. 
I would not go back, unless they were addressed."
1497879,56165276,2015-12-09,4810537,Sean,"Great layout and exactly what I was looking for. Sara was communicated very well and the apartment while small, has everything a passing through traveler would need. I was worried about transportation, but many Uber cars are around even at 5:00am. "
1497879,56239381,2015-12-11,44796408,Temeka,Had a great time at Sara's - it's such a convenient location to the airport! Thanks so much!!
1497879,56642563,2015-12-15,3660628,Michelle,"I stayed at Sara's place for one night on a business trip. The location was great, I was looking for something convenient from South Station. I had a rental and there was plenty of overnight street parking. Her basement studio is super cute, bathroom is fully stocked, and there is even a little fridge/microwave/coffee pot area similar to what you get in a hotel. 

Key pick up was easy, communication was great. She is very thorough, there was even an extensive guide book that she put together with all the info you could ever need. 

Be prepared to carry your luggage down a flight of narrow, steep stairs. My bag was not big, so it was no big deal for me, but if you had huge suitcases it would be a bit of a struggle. "
1497879,56711365,2015-12-16,16297879,Nero,Sara's place was amazing!!! It's a very peaceful and serene setting. Very quiet street.. Cozy house.... And and very comfortable bed!!! 
1497879,56857344,2015-12-19,9564750,Eileen,"Sara is a great and friendly host. I stayed at her place with my boyfriend for three nights, and she was wiiling to help and answer every quesion. Her place is very close to the T station, the airport and downtown location. The green booklet in the room with all the information is excellently helpful. The room itself is cozy. Strongly recommend!:)"
1497879,56968364,2015-12-20,13637574,Martin,Sara and the apartment were both incredible; checking in and out couldn't have been easier and the apartment was very cozy.   Would absolutely stay here again when back in Boston.
1497879,57084672,2015-12-21,6672828,Meghan,"Sara was always readily available and answered all questions promptly. The place was just as it appears on the site, clean and organized. It is an easy 5-6 minute walk to the train station and has very easy access to downtown. The only downside was there seemed to be an open vent somewhere so it was a tad cold and there seemed to be a fly or two that snuck in somehow. Other than that, it was a great stay. The coffee was a HUGE help!!!"
1497879,57191984,2015-12-22,41722092,Matthias,Sara was very kind and welcoming and moving in was uncomplicated. The room is nice and the location is conveniently located close to the airport.
1497879,57239632,2015-12-23,42708536,Wolarpol,Sara was very nice and welcoming. She was very caring to show me everything I needed to know for the studio. 
1497879,57357812,2015-12-24,45498515,Kanishk,"Sara was a very friendly host. She checked us in with great detail in spite of her busy schedule. Her check-in folder was by far the most comprehensive AirBnB folder I've seen and we didn't have questions that weren't already answered. She was very responsive and helped us feel at home!

Thank you Sara... You are awesome! "
1497879,57593733,2015-12-27,49834575,Chaofan,"The room is great with everything you need! And very convenient to public transportation and airport. Also, the instruction book was very impressive with all the detail. Great experience, thanks! "
1497879,58967006,2016-01-05,49446728,Billy,Nice host. Apartment is in a very convenient location. Water pressure is very low making showers difficult.
1497879,59215269,2016-01-08,49904711,Qingya,Sara's mother welcomed us that day since Sara is out of town. She is very considerate and make sure everything ok for us. The room is clean and comfortable. 
1497879,59592726,2016-01-12,14078102,Anderson,"Sara's apartment was nothing short of nice - we did not get to meet Sara, but Susan (her mom) was a great host. She made every effort to make us feel welcome, and we got to even meet her pet Yorkie and Garfield!

The room is true to its' depiction- of course, the steep flight of stairs down was initially a little daunting for us, since we had a quite a bit of luggage to carry, but once we got it in, it was just perfect.

I'd like to thank Susan for being a wonderful host - sharing with us stories about her kids (she's proud mom of three :) ), and life in Michigan, in the peaceful rural hinterlands.

And thank you for the lift to the airport - we can't begin to express how grateful we were for that - you left a wonderful start to our journey in America :)"
1497879,60590879,2016-01-25,33206172,Claudia,"I did not meet Sara but her mom who welcomed me. I had a great stay, everything was just as described. The location is also great, very close to the train station- one stop away from the airport and two to three stations away from the city center- depending on where you exactly want to go. The instruction book with a listing of all the sightseeing and the relevant train station I also found very helpful!
All in all, everything was very well-organized and I can really recommend anybody to stay in Sara's studio!"
1497879,60774743,2016-01-27,38268192,Mélanie,"We needed a simple studio close to the airport and Sara's place was perfect. It is cozy and cute, the bed is very comfortable. It is not far from the Center and very convenient. Sara's mom welcomed us and was very nice. I would definitely recommend this studio. "
1497879,60863046,2016-01-28,23270777,Lee,The place is very close to the airport and also very easy to go to the (URL HIDDEN)'s mom Susan is very nice and considerate for s.Thanks a lot!
1497879,61047300,2016-01-31,36964596,Michelle,The apartment was exactly how described and perfect for our stay. It was in a great location very close to the T stop. We were able to leave our bags early since we got in earlier than our check in time without any problem. I would definitely recommend. 
1497879,61213955,2016-02-01,16591389,Michael,"My wife and sister were traveling with me back to the United States from Portugal going through Boston. The host was incredibly well prepared; there was a comprehensive binder highlighting transportation, dining and anything else we might need.  The host was great company and treated us with respect. We would happily book again next time we're in Boston."
1497879,61373113,2016-02-03,29798301,Sharon,"Sara is a friendly and organized person, and her studio is also very nice and clean. I have a great night staying there. 
highly recommend it!!"
1497879,61444931,2016-02-04,17959626,Philip,"Sara's apartment is wonderful - easy to find, very accessible to downtown and quite close to the airport too. As a hostess you couldn't ask for better - great information about the local area and very accommodating in terms of arrival and departure. 
The room/apartment has everything and is in a nice quiet neighbourhood. I really hope I have a chance to go back again sometime and spend even longer there. "
1497879,61641831,2016-02-07,30416967,Kris,"My girlfriend and I LOVED staying at Sara's apartment for our first visit to Boston. Location was more than ideal (and picturesque) as it was only a few minutes away from both airport and downtown Boston by subway. She was incredibly helpful and accommodating before and during our trip. We will definitely be looking at staying here again on our next excursion to Boston! THANK YOU, SARA!"
1497879,62908416,2016-02-18,55337022,Jenny,"Sara was very accommodating. We arrived late and it was no issue and she was very thorough in helping us get in.  The place was exactly what we needed. Nothing fancy just a place to sleep after a long day of traveling. 

The bed was very comfortable and the place was warm. We didn't use the shower/bathroom, tv, or any amenities so I cannot review. Overall a great place and host. I would stay again, its a perfect location next to the airport and T. "
1497879,63548437,2016-02-24,12210099,Kristen,"Thanks for a great stay Sara!  My sister and I had a perfectly good stay here for our night out in Boston.  Apartment was a little further from the TD Garden than I originally thought (a $10-15 Uber ride) but it was fine for our one night! 

"
1497879,63794074,2016-02-27,10086267,Michael,"I stayed at Sara's place for a residency interview at MGH. Getting to and from both the airport and the hospital was quick and simple, and Sara provided easy-to-follow directions. The apartment is small but clean and perfectly matches her description. Sara was a very attentive host and provided plenty of info regarding local places to eat, landmarks, etc."
1497879,63995282,2016-02-28,56108333,Matthew,"Staying at Sara's was a great experience, my friends and I needed an affordable place to stay for the night and this was perfect. It felt very comfortable and we felt right at home. Would absolutely recommend to anyone!"
1497879,64124564,2016-02-29,39073382,Kelly,The space was great and very easy to get in and out of! Sara was easy to communicate with as well. Thanks for the binder of info--so helpful!
1497879,64276055,2016-03-01,19186475,Amber,"Sara was very flexible, accommodating with our check-in time, and communicative. Exactly as described. Was grateful for the coffee machine :) Located in East Boston, it was a 10 minute drive to the touristy locations (Freedom Trail, etc.) I was able to find street parking before 5pm and we could park for free overnight. "
1497879,64309132,2016-03-02,57630057,Vicky,"The appartment is really cozy and warm. It's really well isolated from souand and light. It's easy to walk from the airport to the appartement.  Just be careful, the park when you get out the shuttle is close so you need to walk by the street. 

I saw some weird people in the streets getting there, but it was midnight. When we leave the appartment in the morning, they was really more nice looking people in the streets ! "
1497879,64512323,2016-03-05,10729703,Dave,"Sara was a great host - could not have been more flexible. We were only in Boston for 36 hours and Sara's apartment was ideal - close to the airport, close to a T system station and local shops.

The apartment was very cosy with a comfortable bed. We appreciated the good internet connection and the Netflix TV service. Having a coffee maker and supplies of coffee was great.

We would love to stay again during a future visit to Boston !"
1497879,64611803,2016-03-06,51358148,Pam,Sara was very friendly. The space is cute and was good for the one night we needed it. 
1497879,64830902,2016-03-08,57459981,Wendy,"The cab drivers didnt know how to get there, but it was very close to the airport ans convienent. Sara was very nice and everything in the description was accurate."
1497879,65793454,2016-03-17,55324589,Dante,Extremely welcoming and friendly! Sara is a wonderful host and has an excellent knowledge of the city.
1497879,66035221,2016-03-19,53767236,Ricardo,"Sara was great and very helpful, the place was very cozy, just a quick walk from the subway station in a great location.

It was our first experience with AirBnB and we really enjoyed it, she went as far as providing coffee, disposable utensils, a small but very nice DVD collection, lots of brochures about local atractions and take out fliers.

If (when) going back to Boston we're definitely looking to stay there again."
1497879,66182938,2016-03-20,4744261,Vatana,"Had a nice stay! Was only in town for 1.5 days so this was perfect. The apt is accurately depicted in the post, which is important to me. "
1497879,66362088,2016-03-22,50136332,Seth,"Everything was great - Host was able to get us checked in late and the bed was very comfortable - Had a washer/dryer, fridge, coffee maker and great internet. All that was so nice and it's close to a Metro Line - Best deal in town!!!"
1497879,68326357,2016-04-04,6959677,Hannah,"We had a nice, convenient stay at Sara's apartment. She was easy to communicate with, and was accommodating with our arrival time. Location is great, within two blocks of the T and a nice view of the river and the city!"
1497879,68365928,2016-04-04,34767156,Michael,"We were warmly greeted by Sara and then shown around the hosts guest area. Sara explained everything and also directed us to the folder she had prepared for guests ( this lists in a clear way everything you need to know). The place was ideal for us , positioned on the east side of the City with easy access to Logan Airport and the MBTA. We had a comfortable stay."
1497879,68882502,2016-04-07,33933097,Tom,"This is a great apartment. It was clean and spacious, and Sara was very welcoming and helpful. We also appreciated the coffee machine and small fridge.

We didn't get to check out much of the neighbourhood but it seemed quiet. We walked from Logan airport - probably about a 30 minute walk and would have been difficult without GPS, but doable if you want to save a little on a cab."
1497879,69636399,2016-04-12,13453651,João,"A estada no apartamento da Sara foi excelente. Acomodação confortável, limpa, organizada e a poucos metros do metrô."
1497879,69802350,2016-04-13,4144226,Lauren,Easy to get into the location great place for the price. It was super easy to get into and out of. We were going straight from the airport and back the next morning and it made the commute very easy. If you are allergic to cats this is not the best apartment for you since my friend who has mild allergies needed to take medicine.
1497879,69860793,2016-04-14,15028719,Lauren,"Sara was a great host and very easy to communicate with. The apartment was the perfect size, value and location for our overnight stay in Boston. I would definitely recommend staying here."
1497879,71304025,2016-04-24,30486651,Patrick,"We had a lovely time in Boston, thanks in part to Sara and her very accommodating place. The bed was comfortable, and there were numerous accommodations to make the day-to-day easier, including coffee! Sara's instructions for getting into the place were great, making it easy to come and go as we pleased. "
1497879,71540909,2016-04-26,34759008,Mike,Cozy little place to stay. We used an Uber to get back and forth to downtown. Quick and convenient. Check-in and out instructions were simple. 
1497879,71682934,2016-04-27,6755866,Rajiv,"We didn't get to meet Sara in person, and had unique circumstances, in that we arrived late in the evening, and had to leave again at 330 am for a flight, but her place functioned perfectly as a 'crash pad' for the night, allowing us to get a little rest, and shower, before a further 20 hrs of flight. Be advised that the stairs down are extremely steep - fine for normal use, but may be difficult if you're wrangling substantial luggage, children, or if you have limited mobility. I appreciated that Sara was prompt in responding to a text regarding a question I had while we were there, and there's a really cute little Italian place in easy walking distance which was featured in DDD. We enjoyed our stay, and if ever we found ourselves needing to stay in that part of Boston again, wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. "
1497879,72307248,2016-05-01,14262095,Adi,Fabulous place to stay in Boston! Love the location! 
1497879,73534157,2016-05-08,50413141,Huayi,"Sara is nice and friendly. She guided me through the apartment when I arrived and gave me a folder with a lot of useful information. She also helped me to print out my boarding pass before I check out. The apartment is of walking distance to the T and easy to find. Perfect place to stay for overnight!
Sara非常友好,会热情介绍房间的情况。她有一个册子,里面包含房间和附近交通景点餐饮等的信息。房子离地铁很近而且很容易找到。"
1497879,74571056,2016-05-15,10214852,Amy,"Sara was super helpful and suuuuper sweet! She was very accommodating with having to drop off luggage early and such! Her place was very cozy and comfortable as well! Thanks so much, Sara! "
1497879,74940858,2016-05-17,14262095,Adi,Our second stay. This time for just a quick eight hour sleep! Sara's place is just a 10 min taxi ride to the airport! Perfect stopover!
1497879,75220378,2016-05-19,21504794,Terri,"Sara made us feel welcome be allowing us to put our bags in the room even though it was not cleaned from the previous guests, it was very helpful.  Also she has a book that she made of things to do in Boston, from free to spendy, that was helpful.  The neighborhood was run down, but very convenient to the subway and two blocks from a beautiful park on the ccean, that had a great view of the Boston skyline. Also a little corner market about a block a way for fruit, etc."
1497879,75410747,2016-05-21,50473673,Bryan,"Sara was a great host, very flexible with arrival and departure and the apartment was nice and exactly as described.  "
1497879,76100990,2016-05-24,7039087,Kirill,"We had only one day and a half of night in Sara's place before our departure from Logan airport. The apartment has all you may need. Coffee machine with coffee for guests, detailed information about Boston, comfortable beds. The stairs down is rather steep, in case if you have large baggage. Nevertheless, it is good place for its location and price."
1497879,76198247,2016-05-25,16775212,Caroline,Perfect location for arriving at the airport and exploring the city during the day. All needed amenities were there and the stay was comfortable. Would stay again!
1497879,76302891,2016-05-26,17206723,Devan,"Sara was great. We had a red eye and landed in Boston at 6:30am, and she was able to take our bags at 8am so we could explore the city. We also had a late flight on our departure, so she held our bags until we were ready to leave. She was gracious and we enjoyed staying with her. "
1497879,77245737,2016-05-30,28315359,Christina,Great location to both the airport and downtown via the T. Perfect for our short stay in Boston for a music fest downtown. 
1497879,77541277,2016-06-01,6357314,Evan,"Communication and access was very easy and efficient.
The apartment was just what we needed and Sara was very helpful even suggesting places to park overnight.
Thanks."
1497879,77665649,2016-06-02,31126448,Genette,"This location was perfect for us, very close to the airport when we arrived late and then very near to the Maverick station when we moved on in the morning. 
Sarah was most helpful and met us when we arrived and the room was pleasant enough for our short stay."
1497879,78113186,2016-06-05,41142333,Verity,"PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE BOOKING ANY AIR BNB ACCOMMODATION! DON'T go off the star rating and just read the first couple of pages of the reviews. Sarah's place was one of the first airBnB accommodations we had booked for our USA travel trip . Sarah was very lovely but unfortunately her place was not and it definitely wasn't up to airBNB standards based on the other accommodation we have now stayed at (some places were cheaper and at a 5 star level) There is a constant smell that I can only describe as cat urine or a dirty cat litter tray... and one window with a note asking you not to open it.. Thinking I dropped something, I glanced under the bed to discover a pile of dust which explained our allergies playing up...there was also an incredible amount of dust on the fan provided. It is very close to public transport which will get you everywhere you need to go easily and is only a short trip from the airport. Sarah has a file of great places to visit in Boston, has a washer and dryer which was also very convenient. If the above wouldn't bother you then I say book this accommodation...otherwise please look else where because the price she charges is not worth it. I hope Sara reads this and rectifies the issues I've posted because it ruined an otherwise perfect air BnB. "
1497879,78701435,2016-06-08,56751445,Andreas,"Unfortunately we didn't meet Sara but the communication was excellent. The apartment is located in the basement. The bed is very comfortable, there is everthing provided (towels, tv, a fan, shampoo, shower gel, coffee machine, microwave, kettle, toaster, etc - everthing you need :-) ). 
There are many restaurants, grocery stores and bars in the neighborhood and you are only one stop from the airport with the T  and two stops from downtown. 
Actually we would rate 5 stars or even more because the apartment is really lovely and Sara was a great host. But there was a strong smell of cat pee or something like this... and this ruind the great experience a bit. 
"
1497879,78881235,2016-06-09,37798694,Jenny,Great little studio close to the airport and just a couple blocks from the subway.  Sara was very welcoming and had an organized book of places to eat and things to see.  I definitely recommend a stay here!
1497879,79193904,2016-06-11,8971300,Mariano,"Sara's apartment is great.  Excellent location,  close to the Airport and Downtown.  Just what I needed.  The place was clean, bed was comfortable and it all looked just like the pictures.  Sara was very kind,  and answered all of my questions. I had a great stay!  Can definitely recommend her!"
1497879,79855791,2016-06-14,45175231,Chris,Great location for our short stay in Boston. 
1497879,80007708,2016-06-15,61403005,Nicholas,Great stay.
1497879,80248802,2016-06-17,16240583,Trey,Everything was as advertised.  Very easy to work with.  My only issue was the lack of available street parking.  I did receive a ticket despite moving my car before the 8:00am time stated.
1497879,80506445,2016-06-18,11050498,Sang,"Once we arrived to the studio, Sara immediately greeted us and kindly assisted us with our baggage. I love how organised she is! She has a binder of FAQs  which was really useful. My favourite part of the studio is the fact that the subway station is literally a 3 mins walk away. The area is also safe which made us feel comfortable. 

Thank-you Sara for the hospitality. "
1497879,81410189,2016-06-22,51766938,Ethan,"Sara is a great host, very friendly. Walked me through the apartment upon arrival and made sure I had everything I needed. She was very organized-everything I needed to know (WiFi, nearby restaurants, how to work Netflix/Roku, etc) was contained in a binder she had on the table. I only stayed for one night, so didn't get a chance to use it, but her listing of fun things to do around the city was a nice touch."
1497879,81506289,2016-06-23,44702861,Michelle,Excellent location with plenty of private space.  Sara is super organized and had a folder of helpful information about her place and the surrounding area.  Would definitely stay here again. 
1497879,82671503,2016-06-28,11624242,Joanna,"Sara was really helpful re my arrival & also letting me leave my luggage til early afternoon as it meant I could do more tourist visits on my last morning. Access to the Subway was great - close, & quick into the City. The main entrance is not very nice, and once inside the building, the studio is down some narrow steep stairs which could be difficult for big cases or anyone a bit unsteady on their feet. As it's a basement it's dark. It was a hot spell during my visit & the air conditioner was helpful"
1497879,83037694,2016-06-30,66449285,Ryan,"Sara's place was great for a 2 night stay. It's in East Boston so it's near the airport and only a few minutes from a T station. Everything was exactly as advertised. We really appreciated how thoughtful Sara is - from the helpful binder of FAQs to the signage she posts throughout the apartment - she put a lot of thought and time into making your stay as easy and comfortable as possible. She's also very quick to respond to inquiries and is very accommodating. The only negative that prevents me from giving 5 stars overall was the smell of cat pee that I suspect was coming from the couch. It's possible that a cat peed on the couch some time ago but the smell often returns in the hot and humid summer months in my experience. This may be particularly off-putting to some guests. Otherwise, Sara's apartment is everything you'd want for a great AirBnB experience. "
1497879,83964297,2016-07-04,61434345,Vanessa,"The apartment is very close to an mbta station, which makes it easy to reach downtown Boston quickly. The apartment itself is clean and equipped with everything you might need. It is below ground and has only a very small window that cannot be opened. As other visitors already commented, there is an unpleasant odor that was present during our entire stay. In case you're looking for the ""airbnb experience"" in the sense of interaction with the host, you might be disappointed: we met Sara only for check-in and check-out."
1497879,84484830,2016-07-07,64718583,Wendy,"Sara was very helpful with information.  We did find the apartment very warm, although there is an air con unit.  It is a basement apartment and weather very hot on our stay.  very comfortable bed and fluffy white towels."
1497879,84673546,2016-07-08,23051304,Christine,Sara was a great host. She was great with communication and was easy to work with. The place was in a convenient location. Everything was as pictured. The house did have a strong litter box smell. 
1497879,84991408,2016-07-10,51248224,Gili,"Unfortunately, I was far from being satisfied with my stay at Sara’s place, below is a detailed explanation why I feel that way. 
I arrived at Boston for a one-night stay after a transatlantic flight on my way to another destination. Although I came early in the morning (9:00am) Sara allowed me to check-in and made things easy. Sadly, in a later correspondence with her I found out that  “gesture” won't be possible anymore because (quoting from our email correspondence): ""In the future I am going to make my 2pm check-in time firm, and won't allow early bag drop-off, as it has become too much of an inconvenience to cater to the needs of every traveler's individual schedule"".
 All through the night I heard loud noises from the ceiling above me (be aware that the unit is simply her basement floor), of what seemed to be animals running back and forth. The fact that the noises might have been rates, made my sleeping uncomfortable. Retrospectively, I understood that a dog and a cat were the cause for the noises during the night – a fact that was not mentioned in her original airbnb posting.  For those of who consider rent this place – take into consideration the fact that this apartment is a basement above which two very active pets live. If you are allergic to animals, or if you simply don’t want to hear animals running on the floor above you, simply know that it’s a risk you’re gonna take if you’ll stay there.  
The description of the apartment is misleading: ""enjoy beautiful skyline views from across the harbor"". That is simply far from being true. That view is probably possible from the roof of the building, not from the windowless basement! 
Lastly, alas the least disappointing of all, is the fact that the pathway with the stairs leading to the basement were very narrow which made it very difficult to transfer my luggage through. 
Given the above, it is obvious that if I would have known it’ll be such a disaster, I would have paid more and stated somewhere else. 
After my visit, I email Sara expressing my concerns about the noises; her reply was rude and inconsiderate. To my surprise, instead of showing solidary and understanding, her response culminated in “most city apartments have pets” and “maybe next time you should just go to an hotel”. This is not what I would expect from ANY host. 
All in all, if you still reading that feedback, here is what you need to take from it -if you’re interested in a windowless basement unit with a super narrow staircase, with pets running above your head, and with a host that does not care about your feedback – this is your place!!
"
1497879,85373732,2016-07-11,27065954,Nicholas,"Sara's place was nice for a one day stopover in Boston. It is a small basement apartment, but served our needs for a night. It is well furnished and stocked to make you feel at home. We didn't meet Sarah, but she was very quick to respond to our questions and coordinating our check in. The location between the airport and the city is convenient, and public transit is just a few blocks away for easy access. We loved the neighborhood. It is quiet but lively, and a pleasant escape from the city."
1497879,85551441,2016-07-12,2341179,Laura,"I wouldn't recommend this place in its current state. My family and I had to leave and check into a nearby hotel at 9:30 PM because we couldn't stay here. The main bed broke when my mum sat on it, and the smell of cat urine was overwhelming. 

If the bed wasn't on its side and the place didn't smell like a cat's litter tray, this place would actually be perfect for the airport. The location is great, Sara was very helpful on arrival, the bathroom was perfectly adequate and the tea/coffee making facilities were great. Unfortunately, there was nowhere to sleep and the smell made a few of us quite ill. It's also a lot more claustrophobic than I was expecting.

We got a huge room at nearby hotel for a similar price to Sara's listing. This included breakfast, free shuttle service and a secure place to leave your bags after a generous checkout time – much better value for money. I normally love Airbnb, but this time it let me down. I regret not looking at the reviews more carefully as someone has raised the issue of the cat urine smell before. "
1497879,86097709,2016-07-14,53428069,Andrew,EXCELLENT location! Short walk to park overlooking Boston. Beautiful spot to watch sun set over the city. Neighbor hood felt safe and we walked to local restaurants. Very short uber ride into the city.  Sarah was very nice. Gave some good tips.  Let us know she was available for any arising issues. The place did have a pee smell though.
1497879,86485445,2016-07-16,45465067,Chavonne,Great place to stay for a nice easy commute into the city! 
1497879,87555308,2016-07-20,52931043,Jannis,"We only stayed one night at Sara's Studio, but were more than satisfied.

The place was absolutely clean and tidy, Sara was there to welcome us and the check-in worked perfectly. Furthermore, Sara provides a little book with instructions on how to use the interior, and also tips for what to do in Boston as well as a set of gorcery stores and restaurants in the area. We find that every host on airbnb should provide one like Sara does, and were very positively suprised.

The Apartment is short walking distance to a blue Line station which makes getting into town and back to the studio very easy. The neighbourhood was safe, supermarkets and restaurants were also in 
walking distance. 

Overall, we would stay at Sara's studio again and would recommend to anyone on vacation in Boston."
1497879,88490003,2016-07-24,4031089,Mélodie,"L'appartement est conforme à la description et est très bien situé. 5 minutes à pied du métro, 3 stations pour rejoindre downtown et tout proche de l'aéroport pour ceux qui arrivent ou repartent en avion. Il est très bien équipé et Sara est disponible. Elle répond rapidement aux questions, et nous a chaleureusement accueilli. Un très bon plan sur Boston, ville si chère en qualité de logement !"
1497879,89182279,2016-07-27,74414381,Bitu,"Perfect location, only 5 minutes from the airport. Quiet neighborhood but not far from downtown. I would stay again at Sara's place!"
1497879,89793261,2016-07-30,6357659,Kathy,Waited up for my arrival -  since my plane was delayed and I didn't get in until the wee hours of the morning. Great crash pad near the airport.  I was able to walk to the to airport car rental facility the following day - saving me a night's rental. 
1497879,90636429,2016-08-01,13606131,Michael,"Sara's place is one stop away from the airport, while being very close to the sites of Boston as well. Location wise it's excellent. Sara was there to greet me and was very friendly and provided a full run down on the apartment which answered any questions I might have come up with. Very comprehensive from attractions to restaurants that deliver. It is a small space. You could do three people but it would be a tight fit. It's better suited for 1-2. There's not a lot of natural light since it's basement level. If you need that be aware. The neighborhood is mostly residential so it's nice and quiet. I wouldn't bother with a car. Parking is tight, and outside of East Boston, navigating the rest of the city is an adventure at best."
1497879,91696846,2016-08-06,83200002,Karen,"Sara lives in a great location! The biggest drawback was the staircase, which we were warned about. It definitely was a challenge getting the bags up and down the steep flight. As others have mentioned, there is a litter box smell, though no litter box is in sight. It was nice to have the washer and dryer available, even though we didn't use it. Plenty of room for two people, though. And everything was well stocked -- bathroom amenities and extra blankets were available. Plus Sara had a binder put together with lots of helpful city info. Easy trip to the airport, too. "
1497879,95378772,2016-08-19,82104240,Peter,"Room was as listed, nice location in terms of being able close to the airport and city centre.  I didn't get to meet Sara due to clashes with her work schedule, but she was helpful with queries via email. "
1497879,95774380,2016-08-20,48653824,Marcel,Everything was as advertised on AirBnB. Sara´s place was just perfect for us as we had just one night in Boston. Everything was  nice and clean and communication with Sara worked perfectly. Perfect location if you want to be close to the airport. We would stay again with Sara!
8930592,51104042,2015-10-17,23495332,Robin,"Perfect spot for us to spend the night before flying out of Logan.  It's close to all Boston has to offer and spacious enough for my husband, so and me as well as my parents and the in-laws.  Dan was a great host; answered all  our questions and made our stay more than we'd hoped for."
8930592,51419566,2015-10-19,20335445,Renee,"We were in town and got lucky booking this place last minute, but so glad we did! I was worried about not having a car but the convenient location made things a breeze! 
Besides easy access to the seaport, our beds were comfy, the place was spotless, and Dan responded quickly to my inquiries. Thanks and would def stay again!"
8930592,52440778,2015-10-29,2919938,Kristel,"We thoroughly enjoyed staying in Dan's apartment. It's in a very convenient part of South Boston, within a short walking distance to public transportation, a grocery store, good restaurants and pubs, as well as a few cute, local shops. The furnishings are comfortable; after long days of both work and sightseeing, we enjoyed relaxing in the living room to something on Netflix before falling asleep in the very comfortable new beds. 

The apartment is newly renovated, and we ran into an issue with a leak in the kitchen sink. However, Dan and his property manager were very easy to get a hold of and worked to fix the problem. It really did not affect our stay at all.

Dan was also great recommending places to eat, shop, and visit. I was in town for work, and my mom and sister came to experience Boston for the first time. Not only did they feel safe on their own in the neighborhood, they loved all of Dan's recommendations. 

I don't know when we'll be back in the area, but we'd definitely want to stay here again. "
8930592,52563927,2015-10-30,26841111,Annette,"The apartment was really nice, everything was as described and the communication with Dan was easy and quick. I would take it again!"
8930592,52781932,2015-11-01,2485336,Maegan,Thank you for making us feel so welcome! 
8930592,53225869,2015-11-06,26506338,Pk,"The home was exactly as described and as depicted in the listing photos.  The property is clean, the beds are comfortable, the furnishings are nice, and the home was equipped with everything we needed for a comfortable stay.  The property is perfect for a family or a large group traveling in the area.  As noted in the listing, parking is extremely difficult, so I would explore the recommended app.  We experienced a hiccup in the check-in process, but the remainder of our stay was smooth.  Overall, I would recommend this property to guests searching for a comfortable stay in Boston.  "
8930592,53389403,2015-11-08,47350382,Du,"Helpful and friendly host, good place for family trip. Parking is hard to find around the house, just don't drive or reserve you parking spot before you arrive!"
8930592,53659039,2015-11-10,34305651,Jojo,Dan's place was everything as advertised. It was clean and full of amenities. Great place to stay. Dan was also a great host - very responsive and available when needed. 
8930592,53839121,2015-11-13,9502838,Sonia,Great. As described. Would recommend!

8930592,54300726,2015-11-17,31665470,Fantasia,Nice place when I got there the cleaning lady was still cleaning so we actually helped her out instead of just watching her clean :) very nice place just like the pictures.
8930592,54418072,2015-11-19,37569314,David,It was a great place to stay. I did not bring a car. The TV was set up very nice. 
8930592,54611065,2015-11-22,47282200,Hiroki,"Had a pleasant stay.
The place is clean, simple, and comfortable.
Has access to anything you need."
8930592,55045911,2015-11-27,20797836,Katharina,"I loved this accommodation. We had a wonderful stay. The apartment is very modern, the beds are comfortable and everything was clean. I would definitely book it again. The neighborhood is also very nice. You have a grocery store very close and also some nice bars around (10min walk). And a bus is driving to downtown. Perfect!"
8930592,55875307,2015-12-06,18759636,Paul,"Dan was a great host and responded back quickly to every question and inquiry I had. His place was lovely and spacious, and the area was perfect for what my friend's and I were looking for. 

Highly recommend. "
8930592,56253505,2015-12-11,12159164,Stephen,"The space was just as described, very clean and new furnishings / fixtures. The skylight above the front stairwell, the back deck and the comfy living room made it a welcoming stay for three. Conveniently located with the best of Boston just a quick ride away. "
8930592,56412781,2015-12-13,49503835,Anand,Dan had a fantastic apartment that was as described. He was quick to respond to any questions and made the process as seamless as possible. I would not hesitate to stay there again. 
8930592,59260552,2016-01-08,47741347,Feier,This place is very spacious and looks even better than the pictures! My family and I had a very pleasant stay and Dan and Anya are very easy to communicate. The check-in and check-out process are also very convenient. I'm looking forward to returning in the future!
8930592,59414934,2016-01-10,52590973,Dan,Dan did an extremely good job with the listing and helping us with places to go. The neighborhood was quiet but we were able to play music and did not get any noise complaints or anything. The beds were comfy and the futon was more comfortable than expected. We really enjoyed out stay. 
8930592,60073653,2016-01-18,53970034,Erich,Dan and Anya were unbelievable hosts from their willingness to accommodate to our needs all the way to having the apartment stocked with all the necessities. The apartment was better then expected and gave off a very comfortable feel to be staying in. Next time I'm in the area of Boston their apartment will be the first place to look for on my list
8930592,60341169,2016-01-22,36006746,Hazem,"Awesome experience, very communicative and gave crystal clear instructions as well as helpful advice throughout my time at his place! 

All of his recommendations helped a lot, and it was a great experience overall!"
8930592,61140393,2016-01-31,56597542,Fazeela,Dan's apartment was perfect for us to spend the night. Very clean and tidy and such comfy beds! We had a lovely time and would definitely recommend it to all weary travelers.
8930592,61442254,2016-02-04,5167549,Kimberly,Dan & Anya were great hosts. I've stayed at their Boston home twice now and have enjoyed both trips. They are very attentive and the house is clean and well cared for. I'd highly recommend this option. 
8930592,61638576,2016-02-07,50531480,Ron,Dan was an incredible host! House was beautiful and very comfortable!
8930592,62172793,2016-02-12,46069958,Karlyn,Listing very accurate! Great home
8930592,63193015,2016-02-21,49737845,James,Dan was a tremendous host and made our housing accommodations extremely easy for our convention. We will look to do this again for next year! 
8930592,63757572,2016-02-26,4179466,Tobin,"Dan's place is exactly why I love Airbnb. My brother and our two small kids needed a place to stay for a night in Boston. Having a clean, convenient place with all of the comforts of home made it so much easier than a hotel. Even in the short amount of time we spent there, we got the taste of south Boston and Dan's hospitality. Super convenient to the airport. I'd highly recommend it!"
8930592,64002283,2016-02-28,54005430,Scott,"Great place to stay. Very helpful, organized, and professional.  Clean and very nice apartment.  Definitely recommend staying here."
8930592,64412584,2016-03-03,2809730,Anysia,"Dan était très gentil, il prenait souvent de nos nouvelles, était présent en cas de besoin. 
La maison est vraiment jolie et propre, le quartier est tranquille."
8930592,64489533,2016-03-04,61113793,Trent,"Listing was as described and it was a great place to stay. Its on a quite dead end street and I would stay there again. It was convenient to the city, quiet and way better than a hotel. "
8930592,64620100,2016-03-06,56341999,Jeff,Excellent place to stay. Clean and comfortable with plenty of room for the six of us. Convenient location in a nice neighborhood. Dan was a wonderful host. We would definitely stay there again. 
8930592,65060584,2016-03-10,40614499,Luis Fellipe,Dan was amazing hosting our group! He was always really easy to communicate and made us feel very welcome to his place! He sent all the information before we arrive and made everything clean and comfortable for us!
8930592,65345794,2016-03-13,27282941,Nicole,"We came for a conference in Boston and stayed at Dan's place. It was great - lots of space (3 bedrooms plus a main living room and a kitchen). It was cozy, very clean, and relatively close to the Boston Convention centre (about 20 minutes walking distance). It's in a residential area that we had never been to in Boston, so it was very convenient."
8930592,65836506,2016-03-17,54247328,Avremel,"Great host, Great space!"
8930592,66860919,2016-03-25,60763498,Tito,"The overnight parking situation is not ""tricky"" it's non existent.  Be prepared to pay $30- $40 to park in a garage 10-15min away and uber back.  The place itself was nice, rooms and bathrooms were clean.  A warning regarding the construction going on at 7am right outside the bedroom windows would have been nice.  We woke up startled to the sound of power tools and demolition directly outside the bedroom window.  There was no usable pan in the kitchen, the one that was there had rust all over it.  The place itself and the location was nice.  Take away the parking/Construction situations and it would have been a much better stay."
8930592,67022028,2016-03-26,47059592,Ikenna,Very clean and comfortable. .would absolutely stay here next time..
8930592,68691046,2016-04-06,25900379,Tim,"Overall, very good value for your money. We stayed for a week with a party of five for a congress in the nearby convention center. The distance and connection to the city center and the convention center was fine. For the five of us, the appartment was spaceous enough, the beds were all fine although replacement of the matras of the fold out bed in the livingroom seems to be due soon. The livingroom was too dark (lights didnt all seem to work) and it was quite hard to cook in the appartment since only very old cooking pans were available. Dan was a great host and all his recommendations were good!"
8930592,68908669,2016-04-07,11521068,Emily,The flat was very comfortable and we were very happy staying there. communication was very good and the trip was a huge success. The highlight (for me) was the recommendation to try the Yankee Lobster Eatery down on the waterfront - it was amazing !! Thank you for a lovely stay.
8930592,70670035,2016-04-19,25491107,Si,Very quiet and cozy apartment. Dan is very friendly and supportive. Wonderful experience. 
8930592,70731927,2016-04-20,65899261,Jun,"Beautiful and quiet place to live in Boston. There are three bedrooms and one washroom, big enough for our four people. Very conveinent to go to downtown by bus and train. Dan is very welcome."
8930592,70890276,2016-04-21,62375801,KwangSam,"Cool and good house
"
8930592,71522717,2016-04-25,51662519,Angela,"The listing and neighborhood was just as described: quiet and quaint. The place itself is nice and somewhat spacious, but not for 8 people. Yes, it CAN accommodate 8, but it definitely shouldn't. The bathroom rotations were more ridiculous than we had expected. There also seemed to be a problem with the drainage of the bathroom sink; turning the faucet on for a minute would almost have the sink overflowing. The majority of my group also felt that it was too dusty; sitting on a bed easily got lint all over our dark clothes. Everyone's allergies were also suddenly acting up due to the dusty feel when we first checked-in. The kitchen was nice but the table was not made for 8. My whole party could not eat together comfortable and we had to take turns at the dining table along with the bathroom. Anya was very friendly helpful. It was easy to reach her whenever a minor issue arose. Otherwise, it was a nice stay overall and I would recommend this to friends-who have a smaller party :)"
8930592,71745893,2016-04-28,23344507,Yixiao,Nice house and host!
8930592,72062482,2016-04-30,5776300,Brian,"Dan communicated well and the space was as advertised. It was perfect for our group of 5 who were exploring the city. The deck was a great place to hang out in the morning and drink coffee. American Provisions, just around the corner, had great coffee, wine, beer, sandwiches, and snacks. If I'm back in Boston I would definitely return."
8930592,73262289,2016-05-07,44327356,Clayton,"The place was perfect for myself and my group of friends!!! Parking was a little tricky but that's to be expected.. The apartment was clean, easily found,   And check-in was as easy as could be. Would Deffinately reccomend. Everyone in my group was very pleased. "
8930592,73797688,2016-05-10,19194430,Christopher,Everything was perfect!
8930592,75099932,2016-05-18,62055792,Muwei,"Wonderful host. Nice and easy assess through text and phone. The apartment was good, quiet and cozy. But not highly-recommend for visitors with a car. Parking nearby is really difficult."
8930592,75281183,2016-05-20,21482521,Emily,"A lovely apt located on very convenient location.
Dan is a very helpful host."
8930592,75690165,2016-05-22,7511835,Pino,"Dan's place was very  accommodating for all 8 of us we had no problems with parking and it was in a great location very quiet neighborhood. Very clean comfortable beds very happy with the stay would stay in Dans place again
Thank you for everything

8930592,76096505,2016-05-24,32978473,Ngoc,"Clean and roomy apartment, easy commute to downtown boston. Overall, great stay and would recommend to others!"
8930592,76519197,2016-05-27,12529947,Gabrielle,"Had a great stay in Boston! Coffee in the morning and drinks at night on the patio were awesome. Perfect location to uber anywhere from. Is about a 20 minute walk to the closest T, but small cost to uber there. Great communication with Dan. Would definitely stay again!"
8930592,77567577,2016-06-01,69280496,Gustavo,Really good and clean place.
8930592,77821742,2016-06-03,11877584,Pieter,"We found the apartment as described and it was fully according to our expectations.
Just once minor remark, the cutlery was not for 8 people, but we managed.
To avoid misunderstanding: the apartment was to our satisfaction and we would book it again. In one word: recommended!"
8930592,78095415,2016-06-05,58494554,Nancy,"We felt very welcomed by Dan.  He had ample information about the area, the house, and transportation options.  The listing was very accurate, with a complete manual in the house and  contact information if needed.  Access to the house and locking up information was clear.  The neighborhood was quaint.  We especially appreciated the easy walking to groceries, restaurants, and public transportation.  We had a wonderful Boston experience."
8930592,78439871,2016-06-06,27673849,Christine,"The apartment was just the right size for my parents me and a 12 year old!

We lived the outdoor space and the proximity to the Safeway and other restaurants and  the cheese shop at the 
corner were great.

Great comfy beds too!

Parking is a bear so leave it at home and take the Uber or public transport!

Think about what you might need for cooking and then let Dan know! We needed a coffee grinder and would have loved wine glasses and a blender. Next time!"
8930592,79464974,2016-06-12,67055930,Sarah,"The apartment was clean, beautiful, and on a quiet street.  Dan and Anya were very accommodating and provided everything we needed, including information on local restaurants, shops, and parking.  I would definitely stay at the apartment again!"
8930592,80341419,2016-06-17,60115514,Julian,"This was my first time staying in Boston, and Dan could not have been a more welcoming host. The home was incredible, and the location was perfect for exploring South Boston. Dan did a great job communicating with me throughout the process to make sure our group had a smooth trip, and it made the experience that much better. I highly recommend that anyone going to Boston stay here, they won't be disappointed."
8930592,81356453,2016-06-22,53854924,Amy,"Dan and Anya were great, and answered questions quickly. The neighborhood was wonderful, and very close to everything we wanted to see in Boston. We ended up taking Lyfts most of the time because we had 7 of us, but it was usually less than $9 (each car) to get where we wanted to go. 

The space was just as described, and great for our needs. It was up a steep flight if stairs, which was ok, but I wish I had known sine we were traveling with my 75 year old mother. 

My only complaint was that the dishes were a bit dirty when we arrived. Dan let us come before the official check in time, so they may not have had enough time to get everything cleaned. 

I would stay there again. "
8930592,81622834,2016-06-24,74015059,Eleanor,"I would highly recommend Dan's AirBnB as a great location to the Boston seaport surroundings.  As our first experience, it was a great and clean place to stay.  On a last minute trip with colleagues for a convention and all the hotels were booked -- there was plenty of space for three adults.  We wish we could have enjoyed our stay longer!  

Dan is very timely and responsive - he also had a great list of area places of interests and eats and true to explain the issues with parking if you drive.   I would book with him again the next time I'm in Boston for business or a family getaway. 
"
8930592,82204051,2016-06-26,12987877,Will,"Really nice place - clean, light, accurately described in the listing.  Dan was always quick to respond. We all really liked the neighborhood.  It's about 8 blocks from the waterfront, which has a great path along it. And there are plenty of nice shops and restaurants close by. Relatively easy to get to from the airport.  The T stop (Boston's subway) is more than a mile away but there is a bus line that is really close.  There is also a Hubway station (the Boston bike share system) at the public library right around the corner so you can easily get a bike to ride around the area for $6. The listing said it was a very quiet neighborhood.  On Saturday night, one of the neighbors was playing music really loudly until around midnight.  It didn't bother us at all because we were up and hanging out on the patio (which is also really nice), but I'm not sure if the ""very quiet neighborhood"" description is entirely accurate.  At least not on that one particular night."
8930592,82698740,2016-06-28,2966106,Paige & David,"This was a quiet oasis in busy Boston. Dan's apartment is well furnished with three private bedrooms. The memory foam beds were comfortable and the window unit air conditioners kept us cool while we slept.

We found the transit easy to get to downtown, taking the bus to the T station. Because our visit included Sunday, we were even able to find free parking on the street near the apartment for our car during our stay.  

We enjoyed drinking coffee on the back deck in morning.  The kitchen enabled us to make breakfasts at home in the morning before heading off for our day.  

The wifi was quick and much appreciated as we had a little work to do remotely before site seeing each day.

Dan left clear instructions and was easy to communicate with during our stay.

Thanks Dan!  "
8930592,82780739,2016-06-29,5175067,Anthony,Great host and apartment!
8930592,85371225,2016-07-11,18662654,Dan & Ali,Dan was a great host! He was communicative and his house guide was thorough with tons of restaurant and coffee shop recommendations that were great for our group. The apartment was fantastic as well. Definitely recommend staying here!
8930592,86207841,2016-07-15,7397787,Natalie,Dan was a great host-- very responsive and easy to communicate with. I would absolutely book this place again.
8930592,87848662,2016-07-22,73686584,漢坤,"房屋座落在幽靜的巷子裡,大眾運輸還算便利,有7號及9號公車到市區,附近還有一家大型超市,購買方便,散步在附近街道,居民十分友善,周遭治安良好,是一個美好的住宿體驗"
8930592,88547968,2016-07-24,27497791,Sterling,"Dan and Anya attempted to be good hosts, but.... I travel constantly and have stayed at Airbnb's, hotels, and vrbos around the country. We loved the location here, however we did not feel as if the home was ""luxury,"" besides the fact that it had a large tv. We also felt most unwelcome due to our host's actions. The air mattress which was onsite had a hole in it and deflated immediately upon one of our group members inflating it and attempting to sleep on it. They attempted to charge us $200 for this air mattress after our stay, when clearly it had been damaged prior. To make matters worse, I personally stepped on a nail on the premises. I had to visit the doctor due to this incident with the nail and and believe that things such as this should be addressed/removed prior to allowing guests on the premises. Besides those two things, we loved the location. If we visit Boston again we will certainly stay in South Boston."
8930592,89082496,2016-07-26,36372299,Valerie,"The apartment is cozy and well furnished. It is also very well located, close to downtown and the beach and the neighbourhood is full of good restaurants. I will definitely come back!"
8930592,89943432,2016-07-30,16941643,Catherine,"We had a great stay in Dan's place it was beautiful,  well equipped and excellent communication all the way. Great deck for bbqing. Had a ball! "
8930592,91497162,2016-08-05,7801313,Nelson,It was a nice safe place to stay. We were able to get around Boston quite easily. We tried the Moko and Lincoln restaurants nearby and they were awesome! There is a set of stairs to climb to get into the apartment so if you have a lot of luggage (like us travelling with two kids) then just plan ahead for it.
8930592,92442118,2016-08-08,58726974,Olaf,We spent a great weekend in Boston. The apartment matched exactly with the description. It was very convenient and we could really enjoy the city. Everything worked out very well. 
4494419,22631301,2014-11-10,23275971,Scott,"Despite a late night plane being delayed an hour, a crash in the airport tunnel causing another hour delay, and the public transit train system also being shutdown due to a crash causing me to arrive around 2:30am, 3 hours later than I said I would, Orchid kindly greeted me with a water bottle and a few other things. Orchid is definitely a great host. I despite staying there for roughly 3 days, I never came across the mouse that was alluded to in other reviews. Location ~1 block away from public transit making it easy to get around."
4494419,48902226,2015-09-29,36757018,Blake,"Pros: The room is very close to the metro station. Though in Dorchester, which apparently has a reputation of not being safe, I felt the area was safe during normal commuting hours. 
Neutral: 
Share one bathroom, kitchen, fridge etc with three other rooms which each have 1-2 people. 
Don't really get to know the other guests and everyone remains strangers. 
Very much a ""landlord"" and ""tenant"" atmosphere (i.e there are signs throughout the floor addressed to ""tenants"" and signed by the ""landlord"").  
I didn't meet the landlord until two weeks into my stay, and can't say it was under pleasant circumstances (i.e. the carbon monoxide detector alarm went off. It ended up being just a faulty detector or low batteries). 
General cleanliness (very old box-spring on ground, bed on top of box-spring, spider webs and dust behind bed, in corners of room, and under dresser.)

4924009,25931191,2015-01-30,24374034,Jenn,Great accommodations! 
4924009,28665370,2015-03-28,17016237,Sean,The location was convenient. Ahmed's associate Joe met me promptly to drop off a key and show me the place. The apartment itself is as advertised. 
4924009,28826784,2015-03-30,28815032,Romina,"Regular. El departamento estaba sin terminar. Huecos en la pared con cables que salian. La television no andaba, lo reclame y nunca lo soluciono. El departamento tiene buena ubicacion. Cerca de todo para moverse a pie. Ofrece todos los utensillos y aseos para el baño. El anfitrion no respondia en forma inmediata."
4924009,29486746,2015-04-08,15390410,Victoria,"We have some positive things about this apartment. It is very well located, we walked almost everywhere. Eddie , Ahmed's assistant , is very friendly and did everything possible to make check in early . The appartment is well equipped for two and the bed is comfortable . 
Regarding the negatives: was poorly finished, quite dirty and dusty. Also had holes in the walls , and lights and outlets that did not work . 
As regards the building is very old and we needed to climb stairs to get there. It is particularly dirty and unkempt. It has central heating, so inside the department was warm sometimes and in several opportunities we had cold."
4924009,31795802,2015-05-10,30408250,Ashley,"An associate Eddie, met us at the apartment in good time after our arrival and showed us around our accommodations. The apartment was quaint as we new it would be however must be under construction as there were several holes in the walls (not shown in photos). Another thing we noticed as we were attempting to get ready the next day was that only two out of the several outlets were in working order. 
On the bright side the location in the city could not have been any better. We were within walking distance to Boston Common and the Public Gardens as well as the T station located in Boston Common. There was also a Starbucks on the block which was great! We were within walking distance to several amazing places to eat, the Prudential building as well as Newberry street for shopping. Although we were located right in the heart of the Theatre District which was hopping it was fairly quiet in the apartment. If you are looking for an authentic Boston experience I would definitely recommend staying here!"
4924009,32191010,2015-05-15,17898817,Leonid,"The location is great for sight-seeing, it's close to downtown and many historical sights. The building looks run down but the apartment itself has been renovated. It is nothing special but everything works. Wi-fi access was fast. Downsides: the restroom was quite small, the toilet seat was too close to the wall to the point it's uncomfortable, the exhaust fan was very loud."
4924009,33069226,2015-05-25,15029089,Priscilla,"This apartment is very well located and Eddy are really friendly .

Previous reviews were right when the finishing poorly made and cleanliness average . The bathroom should be renovated and the big holes left by the electrical work make the dubious apartment. Water was also cast light on the bathroom one morning. After a call to Eddy, a man came quickly .

In short, good communication, good staff, good location , apartment flawed .
"
4924009,33505675,2015-05-29,30282678,Chris,"Communication with host was good. It should be noted he is not the owner. It was downhill from there...

Apartment was terrible especially for the price they are asking. Entrance to building was filthy and there was construction debris scattered everywhere. Garbage in the hallway outside the apartment. Inside the apartment was a slight (and I mean slight) improvement. Bathroom was from the 1940's and shower had mould in it. There is drywall cut out throughout it in various spots, exposed electric panel (drywall cutout around it) - odd you don't see the drywall cutouts in the photos??!! I raised all of this with the host and got various excuses/reasons why for all of this. 

I stayed in it for 2 nights and had to leave. I asked for my money back and got nowhere. I realize Boston is an expensive city, but stay elsewhere. for $1100 USD I was HUGELY disappointed. "
4924009,33732846,2015-05-31,33318164,Carlo,"Stayed the weekend at Ahmed's place in Boston. Honestly,  there were some significant differences from the photos and description provided. Over a dozen holes in the walls,  most outlets didnt work,  no air conditioning were the major ones.  We weren't in the studio much so we still had a great trip. Location was good for visiting Boston. Basic amenenties provided."
4924009,34739040,2015-06-11,5107301,Adam,"My stay was excellent, Ahmed was an excellent host and everything was exactly as described. The property manager Eddie met me at the front door for my check-in, ran me through all the ins-and-outs of the room, and also gave me some helpful tips for navigating the local area. 

Others have commented on the look of the apartment, but overall I didn't mind it at all. It's an older building, so expect a bit of wear and tear, but it had a full kitchen and fridge, the bed was comfortable and clean, and it was a GREAT location. The bathroom was a bit small, but it is a studio, so not unexpected. The price was really good for my stay as well, so all in all, I found it to be a perfect fit for what I needed. "
4924009,35327403,2015-06-17,32940601,Steve,"We stayed in this apartment for 2 nights and were pleased with our time there. For whatever reason we found it quite difficult to communicate with our host on days leading up to our stay. We were hoping to check in a bit early and were unable to contact anyone until the day we arrived and fortunately finally talked to Ahmed who passed us on to someone who we coordinated our arrival with. Although temporarily frustrating, we were able to access the apartment without any further trouble and still a little bit early.

A small apartment with the basic necessities we enjoyed our short stay. It was nice being able to watch tv when it rained for a short time. Didn't have any soap or anything in the shower but all in all a good experience."
4924009,37150644,2015-07-05,99411,Dan,"This studio is a 3rd floor walk-up (so I hope you're traveling light) though it's located in a great part of town that is very convenient to the theatre district & Boston Common.  The building and unit itself, however, are still both very much in an ongoing state of renovation. If Ahmed had been a little more forthcoming about this fact in his listing, I'd have probably been a bit more understanding/less disappointed when I arrived, but since it was presented as being a good bit nicer than it was in actuality, well, suffice it to say that I was a bit disappointed upon my arrival. That being said, Boston is an expensive city and housing often seems to come at a premium, so whether you're on a budget or not, you're probably going to be hard-pressed to find anything private in this same area for less than $250 a night, so I suppose that it's best to be prepared for less than ideal accommodations if/when you do. If you're ok with the prospect of quasi economical urban camping, then you should be fine enough with this listing, but if you're looking for a place that's been wholly & completely renovated, or are simply accustomed to getting a good bit more bang for your buck as I have apparently become, then this place is probably not for you, at least not as of this posting. In the 4 years that I've been using AirBnB, this was one of the most expensive properties that I've ever booked, yet at the same time, it was of the lowest standards I've ever encountered. 
In addition to the frequent trash piles often left in the hallways of the building, the numerous holes in the walls, exposed outlets and dangling electrical wires, the bathtub also needs replacing as it is significantly stained and mildewed, and for some reason, the entire building also lost power for six hours one night. Additionally, despite booking an extra day into my reservation to provide for a morning check in, I was still kept waiting for over an hour after my arrival to actually be checked in. It was a challenging stay to say the least. Unfortunately, for this area of Boston, it seems that you're likely going to have to shell out significantly more money if you're looking for a genuinely nice place. I will most likely look elsewhere for accommodations the next time I'm in town. "
4924009,38730016,2015-07-18,2589375,Austin,"The host was very easy to work with and very timely in response. During the visit we interacted with his assistant, who was very helpful and timely to accomodate our stay. Overall the listing is pretty accurate - it's definitely an older building and you can tell. However, it does exactly what you need it to - great place to sleep, clean, friendly, and a fantastic location. It's a great, central location to go explore Boston."
4924009,39417121,2015-07-23,21059638,Henrik,We came to enjoy the location in Chinatown and nearness to Common Park & Back Bay. Eddie the supervisor was of great assistance on various occasions! 
4924009,40483588,2015-07-31,9390941,Kelley,"This studio apartment served my purposes, particularly in it's location, but I have to say it was right at the edge of my creepy tolerance level. The studio itself is ok, although there are a few raw parts still in need of completion - and the bathroom is small in a way that makes the toilet challenging to use (normal sized person here). The window looks straight into a small well at other windows, and a fire escape stair is beside it. It's the entry and hallway in the building that is particularly sceevy, not that that is in Ahmed's control - but it is a factor. One should be used to some rugged accommodations before staying here."
4924009,41057282,2015-08-04,23819374,Thomas,"As the other comments mentioned, the building itself is not the most welcoming place with its exposed wires, trash bags in the hallways and dangling light fixtures. The apartment, however was much nicer. There were a few negative points (holes in the wall, stained/mildewed bathtub) but overall our experience was very positive. We had a great stay there, and you really can't beat the location: it is within walking distance of everything and a perfect place to explore the city when you're there for just a few days. It is right next to Boston Common and Chinatown, which offers plenty of choices for food. "
4924009,41410302,2015-08-07,12639541,Lien,The location of this apartment is perfect. The apartment itself is not so nice. I think it is quiet expensive for what you get. 
4924009,44004379,2015-08-23,14806354,César,Place was very practical and clean.
4924009,44380410,2015-08-25,7535793,Aleksandar,"Getting the keys from the host was a bit harder then expected as we waited for him for quite a while and that part of the communication was not very well done.

The apartment was clean, had the amenities mentioned, everything was as described on the page. Fantastic location! "
4924009,44918368,2015-08-30,15100798,Scott,"The most important matter is always communication.  Ahmed did a great job of keeping in touch before and during our stay.  He ensured someone was available to check us in, show us around, and make us feel welcome.  They were quick to respond to my questions.
They've done a nice job re-modeling the cozy apartment in this old building in Boston, and the location in the city is unbeatable.  If 2 people on a budget are looking for a great place to stay in the city, this cannot be beat."
4924009,50428227,2015-10-12,22694835,Ryan,"Ahmed and his associate Eddie were excellent at communicating and responding to any problems. Great hosts. The apartment was as pictured, but the unit receives almost no daylight, if that is a factor. If location is important, it is really smack dab in the middle of the Theater District...great location. "
4924009,50805992,2015-10-14,45755080,Greg,"Great location, no problems with anything.  The apartment is small, but this unit was about 1/2 the rent of the next closest apartment.  We were met by Eddie to get in and he was patient and knowledgeable.  The biggest negative was that the hallways were a little shabby, didn I mention that it was very inexpensive?  "
4924009,50926436,2015-10-16,37419331,Mercedes,"El departamento es mas chico de lo que parece, esta en buen estado. El edificio no es lindo, se encuentra al lado de una pizzería. 
En mi solicitud puse que eramos tres personas, solo habia una cama, tuve que comprar yo misma un colchón inflable para dormir ya que no tenía otra opción, fue un mal entendido para tener en cuenta.
El departamento se encuentra bien ubicado. "
4924009,51647816,2015-10-22,45927047,Benjamin,"Ahmed was great: fast and direct communication. Location was also ideal - right near the T. CANNOT beat the price. The room was as advertised; no more, no less. Though he's consistent in answering the phone, don't let Eddie (a nice guy) tell you he'll call you back - get a final answer when you have him on the phone the first time."
4924009,52723768,2015-11-01,28999845,Alec,Great little apartment within walking distance of everything in Boston. Would definitely stay again
4924009,53506369,2015-11-09,46298707,Séverine,"Le logement était bien situé. 
Par contre, nous l'avons trouvé sale, il y avait des restes de nourritures sous le lit, la salle de bain était sale, et les draps n'avaient vraisemblablement pas été changés...
Nous n'avons pas vu Ahmed, il nous a envoyé son assistant venu en coup de vent à notre arrivée pour nous remettre les clés. Nous n'avons vu personne à notre départ et avons laissé les clés où nous pouvions !"
4924009,55830133,2015-12-06,25186588,Laura,Great little apartment with the perfect location to explore Boston. Ahmed has been a great host!!
4924009,56545996,2015-12-14,50367317,Juan,"NEGATIVES.
1) I never met Ahmed, only Eddie, his friend...
2)Ahmed is very precautions,  no calls, no sms, no (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN).. weird and lots of drama.
3)The apartment is smaller what I was thinking about. expensive because the buiding is really in bad conditions.
4) Every morning waking up at 8 am, workers making noisies fixing the building. It was compulsory and I demanded as a priority DO NOT BE DISTURBED, and next day I checked in, he said they will be fixing the building.
5) After checking in I didn't have any contact with Ahmed, I was complaining about the noise and I texted Eddie, and he said he doesn't work with that ) that Ahmed is the one dealing with reservations trying to find if he can find another apartment. Ahmed said no, and I didn't like his way just asking for me to explain and he was giving me silly reasons saying that the noisies from the apartment above probably they took the carpet out and that's why I hear the woman walking.
6) 2 floors by stairs, Forget it if u have big suitcase like me! No elevator because building is very old.
7) The bathroom need renovation URGENTLY, decoration from 30 s.

POSITIVES.
1) Hot water in shower and restroom in just seconds.
2) Location is very central.
3) Eddie brought an iron as I requested.
4) Eddie is very sympa."
4924009,56750177,2015-12-17,240316,John,"All the good reviews are true and the apt is just as pictured, but unfortunately the review about construction noise is also true, at least currently (Dec 2015). 
Good news is future renters will have brand new windows, bad news is I was the one woken at 7:30 am and told to leave the apt because they were putting them in, followed by ungodly noise as they broke the windows across the airshaft so I couldn't just refuse and go back to sleep. 
With a noon checkout I think it's reasonable to expect to sleep till 10, but if you need to I'd suggest waiting till Feb 2016 or so before trying this building (though I bet he can charge more once the work is finished). If you're an early riser this is not a problem, and otherwise the price and location can't be beat."
4924009,59332302,2016-01-09,3237977,Jess,"My stay at Ahmed's was convenient, simple, and easy. Communication and check-in & out were all done simply through text. The location was prime! The stairs are a bit shotty in the building; but the apartment is wonderful and makes up for it. Everything you need is stocked and available inside. Overall I was happy with my stay and would most certainly book Ahmed's place again and again! "
4924009,59569666,2016-01-12,48187490,Matías,"Check in at 3pm was very punctual. The neighborhood was awsome and right in the middle of the historical trail and theater district.  The apartement was warm and cozy. 
Cons: 
- the bathroom is DISGUSTING. black stains in the tub, dirty vents. but the worst was the toilet: it was so near the sink on the right and the wall on the left that you litteraly don't have space to ""sit"" properly (my elbows would hit the sink or the wall when i tried to wipe!). 
- the foam in the matress was really thin, you could feal the wood underneath
- the apartment was dirty. there was dust over the kitchen and the fridge that looked like it had been accumulating during months! i dont know why i paid for cleaning service...
Final balance: not worth the money i paid."
4924009,73791230,2016-05-10,42486843,Alwi Bagir,"It was nice unit and good location,
With enough facilities "
4924009,74271030,2016-05-14,64663132,Daniel,Everything promised was delivered. The place was great and the location was ideal for us. Would definitely stay again on a future visit. 
4924009,75561774,2016-05-22,1282424,Jill,"We stayed for a 8 nights while vacationing and visiting some friends. Eddie met us at the check-in time and was very welcoming. The location of the studio is wonderful - very close to Boston Common and multiple T lines. Getting around was really easy via subway or walking.  
The building is old and the neighborhood can be a little noisy at night....frequent sirens due to fire/medical nearby. The bathroom is small and shows wear, and the air vent could use a cleaning, but we found everything functional and when problems arose, Eddie and the building super responded very quickly. The mattress was a thin Ikea one as other reviewers have noted, but we slept fine. It was nice to have the small kitchen and decent-sized fridge so we didn't have to eat out for every meal.  
Overall, we found this studio to be great for our stay and we would stay there again."
4924009,77370360,2016-05-31,11558465,Meg,"We had a great time staying here! The location is right in the middle of everything! You walk out and can head straight down to the park. Tons of restaurants in walking distance. We loved it. 

If you're looking for a brand new, modern type of stay, this is not for you. The bathroom needed some improvements, but didn't bother us at all because we weren't in Boston to stay in a room all weekend, we were there to explore the city! It was perfect for our purposes. 

The hosts were wonderful! The building manager let us store our bags before we could check in, we had an early check in and they installed a window air conditioner when it got too hot!

For the price and location, I'd definitely recommended and stay again!"
4924009,78579487,2016-06-07,64250332,Jackie,"This place was perfect! I could not have asked for a better location. Right down the street from Boston Commons, everything was in walking distance or just a short Uber ride away. 

Ahmed and Eddie were very easy to work with and accommodating when our flights got in a little earlier than planned, and check-out was very easy!

I highly recommend this small studio if location is at the top of your list for your Boston visit.   "
4924009,78952202,2016-06-10,7912845,Catherine,"Well I had read the other reviews so I was prepared for the shabbiness of the building but it was REALLY SKEEVY.  I never met the host, or the elusive Eddie (friend of host) but they had keys all ready to go for me, and someone came to let me into the building no problem.  That person and Eddie were very nice and responsive.  The apartment was fine other than it really needed cleaning (food and dirt on floor in kitchen, hair in shower that wasn't mine) and the mattress is beyond bad, thin wasn't the issue it just has huge dents from being overused.  You get what you pay for with this place.  Great location but CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED.  "
4924009,79457456,2016-06-12,72397127,Jeffrey,"Great location and value. Easy, no hassle check-in / check-out."
4924009,80744222,2016-06-19,67199180,Neal,Amazing location and about what I expected from reading other reviews.  Perfect for my travel needs on this trip.
4924009,81328195,2016-06-22,74752812,Alexander,"Ahmed does not personally deal with this apt. As others mentioned there are other associates like Eddie and Kevin doing the hands on business. The apt is very old; the shower on arrival did not work at all, but they fixed it in no time by sending a ""plumber"" that lived in the same house. So +1 for that responsiveness, but -1 for not checking before we arrived.

In general the place is kinda dirty and does not feel it gets the attention it deserves. Bathroom and main room are affected by that similarly - including the fridge and kitchen elements.

Good part is that the apt is really in good chinatown/downtown boston location.

Due to our problems we had to change to the hostel near by. I would recommend to not rent this place especially if you are not travelling alone or if you want a clean place. The bed is too small to accommodate two comfortably and the bathroom is also very tiny with toilet being almost under the sink.

Thanks!

4924009,90185960,2016-07-31,31117875,Darek,"Ahmed did a great job accommodating me and was readily available to give me access to the unit when I arrived.  

The unit itself is accurately depicted in the photos but is located in a very run down building - not a problem, but worth knowing.  It's also worth noting that there is no elevator and the building entrance door does not lock.  The unit was clean and air was fresh (despite cigarette smelling hallways).  The bathroom is clean, but very old (shower/bathtub needs a face lift).

Overall, I was pleased with the experience and the unit's location is excellent.  It's within walking distance to everything.  Great for someone travelling on their own.

Thank you Ahmed!"

The location seems sketchy at first, but the longer I stayed the more comfortable I felt. The building is old, and that's something you have to take into consideration upon entering! Overall, I would stay again. It was a great location central to everywhere. "

An  amazing roof top terrace offers a beautiful view of the  Charles River and the flat is located within walking distance of the myriad of Charles Street shops, as well as, much of the rest of the city.  For further exploration, the subway, trolley, and bus system are equally accessible.  As we were in the city for a family gathering, our time with Thomas was limited; however, for those unfamiliar with the city, he definitely would be able to offer advice and suggestion as to making the most of your Boston experience.  We would definitely consider another stay!"

8090623,49040357,2015-09-30,43627835,John,"Our host knew it was our first visit to Boston and made every effort to make us welcome.  We arrived late in the evening and he met us outside the front door to make sure we got in OK.  He proceeded to take us on a short tour of the neighborhood, and Beacon Hill is wonderful.  His hometown and neighborhood  knowledge helped us tremendously and we found our way around with relative ease and enjoyed some of the local establishments at his recommendation.  

The space was nice with rooftop access offering a place to relax and enjoy tremendous views of the city.  I hope to be back to Boston in the near future and would be lucky to find his place available.  The value was worth it."
8090623,49381242,2015-10-03,44606276,Lennart,"I enjoyed very much to stay at Thomas' place. It was a nice, clean room and the location is excellent. Thomas was a very nice host and it was no problem for me to arrive very late on my arrival day and to leave my luggage until afternoon on my departure day. Overall, a very pleasant stay and I will definitely check if Thomas has a room free next time I come to Boston."
8090623,49567715,2015-10-04,21649841,Katy,"We had a lovely time at Thomas' place! Exquisite building, great location, and welcoming hospitality!! His dogs and kitten were adorable, we just loved them. He had some great tips about where to go and if our schedule wasn't so packed we would have done all of it! Oh, and the rooftop deck was awesome!"
8090623,49913615,2015-10-07,43245278,Laura,Thomas is a really great and fun guy. His pets are adorable and the apartment is in the best possible location. Great days in Boston!
8090623,51333832,2015-10-19,9534338,Nils Lennart,"Thomas is a great host, very friendly, entertaining, and caring. The location is amazing (walking distance to many restaurants, shops, and to the main tourist attractions). The dogs were very quiet and lovingly. Finally, the view from the roof-top terrace is amazing - 360 degree view of Boston and Cambridge!  "
8090623,52624168,2015-10-31,33520881,Abdulaziz,Thomas was a great host! He was very accommodating and made sure that I was comfortable throughout my stay. I would definitely recommend staying with him If you're in the Boston/Cambridge area.
8090623,55707088,2015-12-04,48699069,Charlotte,"Tom's place is great!  Just down the street from MGH.  I'm a nurse there and I needed a convenient place to sleep between long shifts.  Tom's apartment is extremely clean and has everything you need to be comfortable -- including two cute puppies who like to cuddle.  Tom is kind, informative, and very accommodating.  I placed my request on the same day that I needed the room and it wasn't a problem.  I would highly recommend staying at Tom's."
8090623,59258484,2016-01-08,12841541,Sean,"This is one of those places and host that you hope to find on AirBnB. Impeccable furnishing and cleanliness; simply beautiful views and hood. 

If you get a chance stay here"
8090623,65649336,2016-03-16,34590936,David,"Tom was very nice, social, and accommodating. The location was ideal to get to MGH quickly and even closer to public transit. Everything was clean and comfortable in the apartment, and the building is very nice. The dogs and cat are curious and very sweet. Views from the rooftop are beautiful. "
8090623,66082763,2016-03-19,30198567,Dhemie,"Staying Thomas' place was a really exceptional experience. If there was an award for the best air bnb host, he would definately get my vote.
The room and the bathroom was super clean. You can feel that Thomas really put lots of efforts to make sure you have a great stay. The location is great as well, very close to most tourists attractions and 5 minutes from the nearest t line. i really recommend this place when you come to Boston."
8090623,68661603,2016-04-06,12573103,Jillian,Tom was very accommodating to my request at the last minute. Very warm welcome and covered all details on how to navigate the apartment and building and made a obvious effort to make me comfortable during my short stay. He even let me borrow his Charlie Card! 
8090623,70754677,2016-04-20,60649998,Sébastien,"L'appartement de Thomas est situé dans le très beau quartier de Beacon Hill, lui même très bien situé dans Boston. Ville que l'on peut admirer depuis les toits chez Thomas.
L'acceuil a été très chaleureux et Thomas s'est montré à la fois disponible et avide de nous faire connaître la ville où il vit."
8090623,72641423,2016-05-04,28449268,Jack,Beautiful home in Beacon Hill close to the Charles. Thomas is a helpful and friendly host. I needed to print some documents for work while I was staying with Thomas and he helped me set up and use his printer. Also ready with suggestions for great places to go and eat in the neighborhood.
8090623,73096045,2016-05-06,70364254,Michael,"Great area.  Within walking distance of a lot of different sites. Also a few minutes from the subway.  
Thomas was very nice and accommodating.  He has a wealth of knowledge about the area and is very eager to share.  
The house itself is very nice.  Beautiful home that has been cared for.
The only ""complaint"" i could make would be that it was very warm in the home.  Personal preference, so no big deal."
8090623,75322853,2016-05-20,58641900,Cristian,"Thomas was a great host! Every detail was carefully arranged, making the stay a pleasure.

8090623,77863661,2016-06-04,71000622,Lisa,"Thomas was a wonderful host.  This was the second night, booked separately, that I stayed at his lovely home and it was perfect. As stated in my previous review, his welcoming graciousness and accommodating hospitality really helped me through a difficult time. I was not in Boston on pleasure in fact, my mom was in the hospital so he helped to ease some of the stresses associated with that. 
Thank you Thomas!  I would stay again and will certainly recommend both his home and Airbnb to friends! "
8090623,78415097,2016-06-06,42839564,Ekaterina,"Best AIRB&b experience! 
Really cool historic building in the heart of historic Boston. Walking distance to antique shops, restaurants and Boston commons park. 
Thomas was very nice, friendly and with lots of stories to share. I wish we had more time to stay and learn more about historic Boston from him. 
The roof top is spectacular! Great for enjoying Boston views over coffee or brunch. "
8090623,78778457,2016-06-09,76309026,Beth,"Great neighborhood, kind and friendly host. Very positive experience."
8090623,80004698,2016-06-15,47097347,Ryan,"The location and deck are both fabulous.  Re: accommodations, I'd recommend: 
- getting curtains that can block light more effectively
- outfitting closet with nicer hangers
- this may be difficult to fix but there is a fairly strong dog pee odor.  This could turn off a # of people"
8090623,80228108,2016-06-17,56536705,Andrew,"Thomas was great.  Helped me find a dry cleaner, offered a cold beer on a hot day and truly cared about helping me out and ensuring I had a comfortable stay.  His two dogs are super cute and his home perfect location to some of the best of Beacon Hill.  Clean home.  Great price and comfy bed.  Just as promised. "

He gave me lots of information about local places. The area is perfect - really central to shops, cafes, restaurants, walks and public transport. The apartment is beautiful. "
8090623,89319042,2016-07-28,85122180,Elisabeth,"Accueil très chaleureux. Nombreux conseils. Quartier fort sympathique et terrasse de l'immeuble aussi, avec vue magnifique.  L'emplacement est cependant bruyant, du fait de la proximité de l'autoroute urbaine. "
8090623,91164472,2016-08-04,82453285,Wayne,"Thomas是个非常热心的人,几乎考虑到客人所有的要求,且随时响应客人的新要求。公寓所在位置极好,离BostonCommon、Charles River几步之遥。

8090623,93488407,2016-08-13,31747952,Emily,"Thomas was a terrific host! Not only was he accommodating and open to me dropping off my bag prior to check in, but he was a wealth of Bostonian knowledge. He knew how to get everywhere and was available to help me with my many questions. His place is an excellent location and I'd recommend staying in beacon hill to anyone looking for a central location. "
8090623,94610216,2016-08-16,80942709,Pamela,"Thomas did make us feel welcome, and he is quite knowledgeable on Boston.  "

9918240,58430735,2016-01-02,51863676,Chris,Great experience for our first time using air bnb. The apartment is in a great location and walkable to Copley square and Boston Commons. Wes is a great host and very responsive when we had a question or two. 
9918240,62680321,2016-02-15,41748311,Jessica,"Wes was very communicative via email and phone to make sure we could access the apartment and get settled in. This apartment is a phenomenal location on Comm Ave, walking distance to green line T stops, Copley Square, Newbury Street, Kenmore Square - basically perfectly located in Back Bay. The apartment was cozy and charming, great shower and kitchenette. The mattress is quite firm but very comfortable - not a problem for us. Also of note  is the décor which gave the room a charming character (grandfather clock, old paintings, wood floors). Overall this is a fantastic find and I would recommend to anyone visiting Boston."
9918240,75408789,2016-05-21,39827235,Agustin,Great place in a great location! The room was big enough for 3 people. 
4967219,25532490,2015-01-18,26076421,Ben,Anthony's place is really convenient; close to the subway and downtown Dorchester. Place was heated and he provided bottled water.
4967219,26089599,2015-02-02,18215966,Daniel,"Nice and confortable place, excellent bed, heated, wi fi, cleaned, less than 2 minutes to the subway station. Anthony was super  friendly with us, and even after our stay was done, he accepted us again in the middle of the night when our bus was cancelled. I would definitely stay with him if I ever go to Boston again."
4967219,26554740,2015-02-15,26932547,Erica,"Anthony was a great host! Everything was easily accessible, room was clean and as described. He even offered bottled water, food, and toiletries. Apartment is very close to the T and Anthony's family was very nice! "
4967219,26836263,2015-02-20,27210785,Ying,"Anthony is a friendly man,he give us a lot of suggestion. And the house is so good,close to subway,and room is super worm. The Chinese family hospitable. When we arrived Boston,it
was Chinese New Year,they provided us a lot of Chinese food."
4967219,26900674,2015-02-21,7220925,Belal,"Excellent experience, very nice and clean and 3mins from the T, perfect. Anthony was super Nice !"
4967219,27032395,2015-02-23,3675479,Jade,I'm not very satisfied of that place... They are nice people but I had trouble sleeping because of the radiator that was so noisy and they made me pay 5$ for a towel... 
4967219,27446536,2015-03-04,28057904,Cailing,"It is near T station , the house is really comfortable and nice . I am enjoy the time during in Boston ."
4967219,27769904,2015-03-11,21637594,Amelie,Anthony and the family there were very nice to us. The room is clean and tidy. I saw him taking a long time vacuuming. I stayed at both rooms. This one is bigger than the other. So I got enough space to unpack our two large pieces of luggage. And the apartment is really close to the T. It makes the apartment an excellent choice especially for the travelers who have a lot of luggages. I definitely will choose to stay here next time.
4967219,27835266,2015-03-13,7775448,Spela,"Anthony was friendly, he left us leave bags in the room before check-in. Room looks like on the pictures - nice, clean and warm, and it is quite big. Location is super convinient, metro station is just across the street (2min) and it takes abut 10min to south station."
4967219,27885261,2015-03-14,21637594,Amelie,"Nice host, nice room, nice location, nice choice."
4967219,28016803,2015-03-16,21637594,Amelie,I chose to stay here for nearly one week. Apparently it is a nice place to stay.
4967219,28194201,2015-03-19,12711506,Ben,"Very warm and cozy room, in a amazingly convenient location! Anthony was helpful in answering all our questions. We wouldn't hesitate to stay with him again next time we're in Boston!"

4967219,29375621,2015-04-06,25890440,Marnie,My boyfriend and I had a great experience staying here! The room was clean and comfortable for our short stay. It was easy to find and very convenient. We'll definitely stay here again next time we come to Boston! 
4967219,29476778,2015-04-07,23187254,Mac,"It's a very nice room in a good location in Boston, I could easily get to places I wanted to see in the city.  However the review does not state that there is a family living here, who were perfectly fine but I prefer to stay in places away from small kids.  Just a heads up"
4967219,30443672,2015-04-22,10624609,Mark,"We enjoyed our stay. Anthony communicated well and was well organized. Room was clean, well lit, sunny, warm. Bed comfortable. Desk, drawers, closet, small sofa, bottled water included. Plenty of space for 2. Room is part of 3 bedroom apartment with one shared bathroom. Anthony's family of four live in the apartment, but were away for most of our stay.  A second, smaller bedroom had another airbnb couple for the weekend. Apartment is on 3rd floor, 4 flights of steep stairs from street level. Received large, clean, soft bath towels when requested. Savin Hill T close and convenient. From Logan, take SL1 to South Station and then Red Line to Savin Hill. Close to Chinese and Vietnamese restaurants on Dorchester Ave. Savin Hill Bar & Kitchen restaurant close and good too. Not aware of hot tub, washer or dryer, but did not ask about them. Close to shore line (water), nice for walking or running. Apartment is right on freeway but noise did not bother us. Might be more of an issue if windows were open. Overall enjoyed our stay and would like to stay again next time we are in Boston. Thanks to Anthony and his family for welcoming us into their home!"
4967219,30790672,2015-04-27,12012751,Hilda,Very convenient location and nice room!!! Recommendation!
4967219,31111880,2015-05-02,2930327,Jason,"I don't have much to add to these other reviews.  They and the photos are quite accurate.  The house is indeed literally a one minute walk to the Savin Hill T stop.  I was attending a meeting at the convention center and this was a fantastic way to save money and still be reasonably close to the meeting.  You could even take a taxi from Anthony's house and still come out WAY ahead of booking a hotel by the convention center.    

The bed was comfortable, there is plenty of closet space, a desk, bottled water provided, functional wi-fi/internet.  A great, basic accommodation.  If you go into this space not expecting a hotel and realize you're paying a very good price for a place to stay in Boston, I doubt you will be disappointed.

The truth is, I barely saw Anthony.  I saw him for a total of maybe 30 seconds, but when I did see him, he was quite friendly.  We stayed in touch via text message (prompt responses) and I had no problems with him as a host.   A had a few questions that were responded to quickly.

I kept to the room, but didn't feel unwelcome to use the living room.  That said, there are other people in this space.  Anthony's sister and her young child (adorable).  There is also another room that gets rented out.  There seemed to be only one bathroom, so waiting for the bathroom might be an issue from time to time for some, but was not an issue for me.

Also, the living room had quite a lot of clutter in it given the small kid and her toys and craft projects and whatnot, however, again, this is not something that bothered me as I used this space primarily for sleeping and kept to the bedroom which was clean and orderly when I arrived.  However, if you're someone who is looking for a common space to hang out in during your stay (i.e. not your bedroom), you might prefer a different setting.

Lastly, I was worried that highway noise would be a problem after seeing the photos for the listing.  The house does literally overlook the highway.  However, at least with this particular bedroom, I did not find it intrusive at all.  I also sleep with white noise (from my phone), so maybe take that with a grain of salt, but even when that wasn't on, I did not find highway noise to be an issue.  

Thanks Anthony!"
4967219,31468692,2015-05-05,31254997,Woraya,"Although it's my 1st time in Boston and was a very short stay for a night, I had a very great welcoming from Anthony.He's very kind and full of service minded, helped me alot such as giving pieces of advice for restaurant, places to visit or even how to access to his house. He also cared about me during my travelling alone in Boston by texting me to keep update about my (URL HIDDEN) more big thing was he helped driving me to the Airport early morning at 04:30 to take a flight to Washington D.C. For the accommodation, the room was so clean, had enough space to relax and keep stuffs, bathroom was also nice to use. It was easy to access to any places by taking red line metro,the station was about 2-3 mins walk from the house.I love this place and if I have a chance to visit Boston again, I will definitely stay at his place. Thanks alot again for your big help and warm-hearted welcoming that made my trip in Boston so wonderful."
4967219,31725853,2015-05-09,221342,Pete,The room is nice and clean. Location is nice. And the hosts are really nice!!
4967219,31813188,2015-05-10,31355706,Xiaowei,"Anthony was very nice and gave us some good advice touring the city. The room is cozy and just really a good place to sleep when you are done with a busy day. Location wise, so close to the train stop, highly recommended if you dont want to walk for a while before you hit bed. Overall, would def stay again next time in Boston."
4967219,34857767,2015-06-13,30905824,Jaina,"The room was very clean, although I didn't get to meet Anthony he responded to my questions. There is a family living, be aware for bathroom time. the bathroom needed much cleaning! 
Only Anthony speakers English, therefore ask all your questions before you get there!"
4967219,35205198,2015-06-16,29765309,Brad,"Anthony was a great host and the room was perfect for for our visit. It was only a minute or two walk to the train and in a nice area of the city. Walkable restaurants and a drug store. There is a small beach at the bottom of the hill that was great to walk to and eat lunch and relax for a while. I had questions for Anthony regarding the stay and the area, as our trip got closer and he was very helpful in answering them."
4967219,36289773,2015-06-27,33539181,Rafael,"We had a wonderful time at Anthony's. The place is clean,  confortable and very near the highway and the train station. He was there when we arrived to show us the house and offered his assistance at all times, even before we get there."

4967219,37643961,2015-07-09,1019380,Sigurlaug,"We stayed in Anthony´s apartment for a week. The room was clean and had air conditioning and wifi. We had a busy schedule and didn't spend much time at ""home"". The proximity to the Savin Hill tube station (red line) made our travels easy. Anthony was easy to get in touch with through internet and available to answer any questions we had. Other family members, living in the apartment, spoke very little English but were friendly. An overall good experience!
P.s. If you are a bad sleeper you might want to bring earplugs because the apartment stands next to a highway."
4967219,37737176,2015-07-10,25217132,Nina,Room was nice. Only one minute away from the subway. Anthony was also very nice.

4967219,38833256,2015-07-19,29708662,Yu,"非常好!很高兴能在异国遇到中国人。房间整洁干净,还可以加床垫。厨房有中国厨具,可以做一些简单的饭菜,好过汉堡和热狗很多。尤其惊艳的是遇到一位常住房客阿姨,热情好客,非常感谢她!"
4967219,39175506,2015-07-21,31986948,Natalie,"This location is amazing! Steps from both the subway (the T) and the beach, which is so convenient. As far as the actual room goes, it was clean and good for a night's sleep. The apartment is on the third floor so it could be an inconvenience if you have a lot of luggage. Also, the apartment can get pretty warm in the summer time, but there is an A/C in the room which is definitely nice. I didn't have any interaction with Anthony during our stay, but he was very responsive to questions before our arrival. Overall, it was a great place to stay and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again if I ever find myself in Boston. "

The room was spacious and clean, a little bit noisy, but nothing to be scared about. 
The family was very welcoming and helped a lot. 
Good shower, good bed, good air conditioner. Don't need to ask for nothing else. "
4967219,39498079,2015-07-24,28719254,Dave,Anthony was very good and communication and helpful with check in and out. Didn't actually met him. The people in the property we very friendly although didn't speak English. The room was spotless and had air con. Location was perfect less than 5 min walk to subway so really easy to get into centre and some really nice restaurants close by. The road noise didn't bother us at all.
4967219,40000920,2015-07-27,36443585,Katie,"I didn't get to meet Anthony personally, but I did reach him easily on the phone when contacting him about checking in! His family welcomed me and my cousin into the home and we got situated easily. The room was great-just as advertised, and the air conditioner worked well after a long day out on the town. His house was right across from the subway, that was easy to navigate and took us downtown. In the morning his aunt was very kind and made us breakfast! Anthony's place was very accommodating and I would definitely recommend it to anyone needing to stay in Boston!"
4967219,40321315,2015-07-30,4969829,Richi,"Anthony was very reliable and answered  all my questions with quick response. 
His aunt quickly made the room when I arrived early in the morning."
4967219,40572326,2015-08-01,8300168,Daniel,"I didn't meet Anthony face to face but everything was done to ease our stay and arrival even in late arrival due to flight delay.
Anthony family was nice and the room was as described.
Clean room, comfortable bed, air conditioned and nice neighborhood...(Mc Kennas cafe is a great place to have good breakfast)
Very close to Red Line  and 20min from downtown by subway.
Nice location in Boston!"
4967219,41335111,2015-08-07,22171429,Ge,"Even I didn't see Anthony during the days I spend at his home, but he actually did everything for me to live better. It is so convenient to the Metro station and also, Boston is such a place that you can get anywhere you want with a metro station. thanks! Hope can come back again! "
4967219,41686881,2015-08-08,39697072,Maria Camila,Excelente ubicacion a unos pocos pasos de la estacion del tren. El barrio muy agradable y la habitacion muy limpia y comoda :)
4967219,42258450,2015-08-12,32690740,Thomas,"The room was as described. It was very loud because of the Highway directly in front of the house. The T-Station was in 2 minute Walk distance. Anthony organized everything perfectly for us, but we did not meet him face2face. The communication with his family members was hard, they dont speak english. "
4967219,42848247,2015-08-16,34780449,Seth,The location is great just a minute walk to the T and there is a beach just minutes away as well as jogging paths.   We didn't see Anthony but everything was as described in the posting.  He and his wife were readily available by email and cell to answer questions we had.  The on street parking was very convenient.
4967219,43657477,2015-08-21,39107843,Maherin,Overall it was good and best thing was accessible to T stop.
4967219,43930369,2015-08-23,33472361,Le,"交通非常便利,只是稍微马路噪声有一些。其他都还好。"
4967219,44125871,2015-08-24,14754029,Ania,The place is a few minutes walk from the metro line that takes you directly to the city centre and Harvard (around 20mins). The host was very responsive and the lady who cleans the place was absolutely lovely and incredibly helpful.
4967219,44358491,2015-08-25,22546360,Avanti,Thank you Anthony! Everything was very comfortable. The house was very conveniently located near the subway so it was easy to get around.
4967219,44423536,2015-08-26,18475954,Yue,it is very noisy but OK
4967219,44893579,2015-08-30,25629022,Cinzia,"Good place for a quick visit to Boston, literally 2 minutes from subway station. Anthony is a very nice host, quick and accurate in his communications."
4967219,45148969,2015-08-31,40249854,Viyat,Enjoyed my stay. Would recommend it. 
4967219,45657472,2015-09-05,33751301,Yanjun,"屋子干净整洁,房间比较大,设施齐全。距离地铁很近,到波士顿方便。房东很热心,有问题都能及时解决。美中不足是距离主干道太近,晚上有点吵。总体来讲满意!"
4967219,45781547,2015-09-06,13108146,Robert,"We were very happy with how quick Anthony was to respond to our messages. Anthony’s home was very clean and convenient to downtown. The room was warm and cozy, and everyone we saw (other travelers, Anthony’s family) were very nice. It is noisy, but for us it was good background noise to fall asleep to. You might have to wait for the bathroom, but otherwise it’s a great place to stay!
"
4967219,46156498,2015-09-08,19303249,Sabrina,The place is cozy and clean. Very convenient location next to the red line. Everything is good except that it is very noisy at night since it is so close the the highway.
4967219,46369603,2015-09-10,29021507,Andrea,Muy amables. Habitación y sabanas y toallas muy limpio. Baño y cocina limpio. Anfitriones gentiles . cerca de subte !!! Recomendable ....suerte
4967219,46605258,2015-09-12,37985032,Lucía,"we didn't see Anthony but he left us precises instructions to get the keys. his family is nice but they dont speak much english. the room is as pictured, neat and clean, as the shared bathroom. 
the only but is the noise. the house is near the road and the railways. for us it was ok to stay at boston."
4967219,46871775,2015-09-14,34171496,Jonas,Anthony was a really nice and friendly host. You can get really fast to the train and to south station. (FYI: The last train goes around midnight). Unfortunately the toilette and our room were not very clean. 
4967219,47083714,2015-09-15,34270949,晓悦,"A good place to stay,and very near to the metro station.I left my watch in the (URL HIDDEN),Anthony informed me of this."
4967219,47961331,2015-09-22,30776162,Angie,"Very good location, 5 minutes walking from the subway station.

The room was very sunny and clean. We had enough space. There's a small desk, small furniture to hang your clothes and a mini sofa. It was all very convenient. 

Anthony perfectly explained us how to reach the house and get the keys, it was all very easy. 

Nevertheless, there's a little negative point, the room is pretty noisy. There's the highway just close by the house. But with ear plugs, we slept perfectly.

It was a very nice place to stay for visiting Boston !!"
4967219,48581772,2015-09-27,26073257,Christiane,Anthony had sent us perfect information before we came. Unfortunately at that time we hadn't understood that the text message we had received was not the complete information and that the lacking part was standing in an extra email- thus when we arrived it took us a bit of time to understand how everything was going on ;-) The room was nice and clean and the public transport into Boston very easy. Just for people who are very sensitive to noise it can be very loud because of the nearby highway .
4967219,48681625,2015-09-28,32958774,Ilaria,"The room is very bright and it is only two steps to the train that brings you downtown Boston! For that I recommend it to those who want to get easily to the city because it's not far at all! 
I was there with my boyfriend just for one night but honestly if we had booked for more nights I would have rather spent the double of the price and booked a hotel room... the bathroom was very dirty, hairs all over the floor and we wouldn't have managed to have a shower there if we weren't together! We didn't want to touch anything indide the bathroom! And since there it lives a family we didn't feel comfortable to use the kitchen and other spaces in common....
Anyway the room was clean, but since it is beside a high traffic road and the train it is noisy as hell! We were tired, that's why we had no problem to sleep!"
4967219,48893252,2015-09-29,39726017,Hayri,"Location of this house is really perfect. 2 min to subway on foot and and with subway you can reach wherever you want. Anthony and his family is kind and hospitable. The only problem is that they don't English except Anthony. Sometimes it can be hard to communicate with them cuz or that. He also allowed us for late check-in. However, on our last day nobody was at home and we had little problem to take out luggages from his home. To sum up, i recommend this pretty house, you won't be regret. Thank you for your hosting Anthony!"
4967219,49217118,2015-10-02,11411460,Aleksandra,"Although we didn't meet Anthony personally, we had a pleasant stay at his appartment. The room was clean and big, the AC worked fine but earplugs are a must if you're a light sleeper. We didn't use the kitchen and the bathroom is shared with all the rooms. 
The communication with Anthony is great, he responded very quickly to every message and when we arrived, a family member was there to show us the room (not speaking English but we managed to communicate :)). It was a good experience overall."

4967219,50290548,2015-10-11,41467191,Kyuwon,"I thought that my first Airbnb experience was okay. I really liked the room at Anthony's place, but right, the noise outside next to the highway was extremely disturbing. But then, the location being accessible to the public transportation was awesome, and the price was reasonable. I wouldn't go back to it just because I found the bathroom floor not clean at all for having a guest over. But I would prefer coming here than choosing a hotel because I felt safer and more like home in this place."
4967219,50830257,2015-10-15,34398324,Pierre-Luc,"We stayed at Anthony’s place for 4 nights. It was our first Airbnb experience and after that, maybe our last.

We actually never met Anthony but only had contact with his family (as least we thing it was his family). She could barely speak english and we had a really hard time communicating. 

When we arrived we found hairs in the bed. There was no flat sheet, only a fitted sheet. We had to sleep with the duvet cover in direct contact. They were no other blankets and the room gets really cold as it it drafty. There was a bad smell in all of the appartement.


The worst part; The bathroom. It was smelly moldy and overall dirty. There was hair on the floor and the sink. The walls were covered in dirt and leftover glue from message that were glued on the walls. All hand towels were wet and smelly so we had nothing to dry our hands after washing them. The bathtub was moldy and very dirty. There is no fan in the bathroom and the window was always left closed so it smelled bad. We always felt dirtier after leaving the bathroom. The sink counter was always covered in water that was droping on the floor. The bath mat was always soaking wet. Towels were not provided. The timeframe to use the bathroom was also impossible. Since we couldn’t communicate with the family, we never knew when it was ok to take showers or even go to the bathroom. There was only one bathroom for everybody so it was almost always in use. When it wasn’t, it was even dirtier than before. Each morning, after the family used the bathroom, the lady would use the bathroom sink to clean and rinse her mop, there was brown dirt water and hair everywhere. Only after that we could use the bathroom and by then, it was almost 9;00. We tried to take our showers at night but the bathroom was also always in use. 

We were also supposed to have acces to the kitchen but it was so dirty  (food from the night before still on the table, plastic bags full of stuff on the counters) and there wasn’t any space for us. We only wanted to put a take out box in the fridge and there weren’t any space.   The pictures that you can see on the page are clearly of before they moved into the appartement

The pictures are also not of the present bedroom used. Furniture is not all the same. 

We would not go back. The price of the room is high for such a bad experience. It is also very noisy, even with earplugs we could ear the Highway.
"
4967219,51273955,2015-10-19,14262853,Marijn,Although my girlfriend and I never got to meet Anthony check in went smooth with the instructions provided. Our stay was pleasant! The room was big and clean and the bed comfortable. One night it was pretty cold  and we were provided with an extra heater which we really appreciated! Communication with the Family that also lives there was minimal because of not speakng English. Nevertheless we felt welcome all the time.
4967219,51518830,2015-10-20,46883943,Donna,I never met Anthony.  He emailed after 1030 at night to see if I had any questions. 
4967219,51701669,2015-10-24,37957128,Pratthana Noon,"I like the fact that location was very convenience to a train also close to many restaurants and grocery store. The room was ok and price was reasonable. Host was nice even though we couldn't communicated but she tried her best to help and also we got a little girl helping to translate. Be Careful if you are living room#3 door knob couldn't be locked from inside it would like a trap and it took us to open the door like 30 mins. There was only 1 bathroom in the apartment ( We have to say that as We don't think it is a house, it look more like 3 bedroom apartment to us) it could be traffic to use a bathroom and it's not clean enough!!!! Rugs were wet, toilet bowl cover had some sticky black dirt on it. I gave 3/5 as everything was quite nice if comparing with the price. "
4967219,51878545,2015-10-24,41829977,Sonam,"Anthony's place was nice, Family members that lived there were also friendly. Anthony was very helpful with communication and made sure everything was okay.  The bathroom was not that clean and did find some hair on the bed -.- Other than that no complains. "
4967219,52540412,2015-10-30,47109263,Lxmobley,Anthony's place was great! Awesome balcony with a beautiful view. Bed was clean and comfortable and the family was very gracious. Convenience to train station was much appreciated. 
4967219,52586678,2015-10-31,29814086,Victor,We just spent one night in this room. The communication with Anthony was very good. There is park space outside and easy to arrive. It is located in a neighboorhood with Vietnam population. Someone from Anthony's family was at home when we arrived. She didn't talk English but she showed us what we needed. It was an usual room next to a main road (a bit noisy but we slept anyway) with TV and heating.
4967219,52827814,2015-11-02,39663119,CiCi,"华人房东,人超级好,我咨询了很多问题,都一一解答,还热心帮忙打印球票,太感谢了!!住处就在地铁站旁,很方便乘坐地铁。只是窗户或许为了隔音不太透气。房间很大,床很舒适,推荐这里,非常好!Anthony is a great host,super friendly,room was big and clean,it's a good place to stay,metro is in front of you!"
4967219,52966773,2015-11-03,39663119,CiCi,"之前订了两晚,后来又订了一晚,一共三天,觉得非常好,离地铁太近了,走哪儿都方便,顺便推荐一家附近的餐厅,就在地铁站旁边,叫mckenna's cafe,只做早午餐,觉得很好,价格实惠。总之这一个区域真的很好,住在这里棒棒的!"
4967219,53161213,2015-11-05,42527770,Zachery,"this was falsely advertised, and arguably the worst place i have ever stay. ever. 

pictures are not accurate. 

the kitchen is so disgusting that the only thing we, very cautiously, used was the toaster.
the disgusting kitchen causes the entire apartment to smell bad.

bedroom is 'clean enough'.

did not meet anthony, but he seemed nice via text, email, etc."
4967219,53941343,2015-11-14,48522835,Mena,"The trip went smoothly and Anthony was very communicative and accommodating. The bedroom is in a walk-up apartment- very conveniently located by the train station (red line). Great location if you are visiting colleges in Cambridge because the Red line takes you strait to Harvard Sq and MIT. Even if you bring a car you would save so much time and money taking the train (parking in Boston/Cambridge is a nightmare). 

The bedroom is nice and clean!  The bed is comfortable for two. There is also a space heater in case it gets cold. And the TV was a pleasant surprise! We brought an extra blanket and pillow and it was definitely a good idea! Also consider bringing your own house slippers because the owners do not allow shoes inside. 

Overall I would recommend staying here for a night or two if you are swinging through Boston. "
4967219,55193533,2015-11-29,20777631,Beatriz,"It was what I expected. Really a very clean place. Although it is located right in front an avenue, the traffic noises were not disturbing. I recommend it. "
4967219,56747998,2015-12-17,48376210,Crystal,"The room is clean and big, location is really good. But the air in the room is not that fresh because the windows are sealed. Also you would be living on 2nd or 3rd floor, we have very heavy luggages and that's a pain. Anthony is very nice though. "
4967219,56900925,2015-12-19,49050886,Wantong,"The experience here is really great. Real close to the train and the little town. It would be totally fine if you return not too late. Water is hot, rome is big enough for two. Windows are big, and not noisy though so close to the train. After all pretty great, wish I came earlier."
4967219,57014459,2015-12-21,17953312,Philipp,"Positive: Private room, very clean, located 2 mins walking distance from the t-station (12 mins with the train to downtown). Also the bathroom was nice and clean. Anthony is a polite and friendly host. We could check in right at 2pm (earliest possible check in time). There is a TV and a fridge in the room.

Negative: The room was cold when we arrived until we found out how to turn on the heating. To have it warm at night, you have to leave the heating on which means that the light emitted by the heating will also be on. On the second day, the bathroom floor was completely wet. It's not possible to open the windows for fresh air because there is plastic between the windows and the shades on the inside."
4967219,57246412,2015-12-23,28308052,Yan,"The house is very close to the subway station, and Anthony is very patient and helpful in solving the problem. Also, the bed is very comfortable :)"
4967219,57642477,2015-12-28,28915707,Shu Qi,"The place was clean and as pictured. Very convenient location, minutes from the train. Response to anything asked was very quick although we never saw Anthony."
4967219,57800504,2015-12-29,43778329,Songyuan,It was really cold outside when I was in Boston. And Anthony's place don't have central heating but there is one radiator working in the room. The windows were sealed by plastic film but you can still feel a little wind blowing in. I thought it would be cold that night but I didn't feel anything after falling into sleep. Maybe it is because I was too tired. The house is just one minute walking to metro station. Really convenient. It is not a bad experience anyway. 
4967219,58857112,2016-01-05,42967571,Annika,"First of all, Anthony and his family was nice and friendly and tried to make our stay most comfortable as possible under the rooming conditions. However, the room was incredible cold, the windows were covered with kind of plastic wrap to keep the wind and cold away but it did not work out at all. The room faces the highway and it was horrible noisy as well during the day as well as in the night! It was very difficult to fall aslepp as a matter of fact."
4967219,59211479,2016-01-08,48202394,Doris,"The location is very convenient which only takes 2 mins to red line subway on foot, and red line can bring you to many attractions. 
The bedroom is spacious and clean, but the bathroom is acceptable because it's public use. By the way, the door lock is broken which we spent much time managing to open the door. Hope the host can improve it :)"
4967219,59667438,2016-01-13,53453874,Linjie,"first of all, I have to say thank you so much for the bedroom. the location is great, which just took us 2 minutes to go to the red line subway station. And the neighborhood is very kind.

However, I have to say, the bedroom is so cold that we can't sleep well at night. During the time in Boston, it snows, but the center heater doesn't work, even we opened the electric heater, it still feels cold inside. SO I think Anthony should repair the heater system, no one wants to get cold during their trip, all right?

all in all, the bedroom is good and it worth the price. Thank you Anthony!"
4967219,59808704,2016-01-15,9841755,Long,"I have used airbnb for almost 3 years, either by my own account or my sister's account, and I have to say this was my worst experience ever. I honestly never want to write anything negative when leaving comments, reviews, but last night was just too much for me. The biggest problem was the heater. It was ok during the 1st night, just a little bit loud. But on the 2nd night, it started to make very loud and weird noises periodically, about 1-2 times per hour, for the whole night. When I left the place, it was still making loud noises and all that completely ruined my night. I almost could not sleep the whole night, it was like a long nightmare, and the next day was a long day for me. I messaged host, he replied instantly but there wasnt anything that he could have done. I dont know if it has happened to anyone before, or I was just unlucky, but that was really the worst night ever I had using airbnb.This was a horrible experience. 
In addition, the bed was really bad. It kept collapsing very frequently although I was really gentle, and I had to keep fixing it. I cant even turn myself normally during night because it may collapse again. It was a really bad bed.
Again, I never want to post a negative comment, but this was just too much for me. I guess the only cons is that parking is easily available, and maybe a relatively low price. But still, I think for that price I can get a better place where I can at least sleep peacefully at night.
Lastly, Anthony was easy to contact with, he replied me instantly."
4967219,60130390,2016-01-19,35906223,Barbara,"Nice neighborhood, quiet as far as foot traffic and immediate road traffic goes. Free parking on street, but that can get filled up at the wrong time of day. Unfortunately, the house is situated directly next to I-93, so lights and highway noise 24/7. Never met the host, don't know if he even lives here. Did meet other guests, plus someone who I think lived there? Not sure, as we were unable to communicate in English. Everyone I met was very nice. House rules didn't indicate whether it was okay to use kitchen to make hot water for tea in the morning. Had continual trouble with lock on door room. First lock was changed out, second lock also stuck. Easy foot access to open space on beach, but walking to UMass campus is not as convenient, involving a larger detour to foot bridge across major road. Easy MBTA access - the station is right on the other side of the highway."

4967219,63937050,2016-02-28,17242786,Olivia,"Anthony is very accommodating. He is very reliable by text, he is flexible for check-in time and lets you keep to yourself and go about your travels. The apartment looks just like his pictures, it is just across the street from the subway line, and it's 20 minutes to get into the city center (by the main train station and theater district). It's 40 minutes to BU, or Cambridge area. It's very easy to get around, and there are some restaurants/bars around if you don't feel like going back into the city. There is a bar called dBar that is said to have a good brunch, and McKenna's was packed. A heads up for early birds, there isn't much that is open before 11am for brunch on the weekends. Also, if you're into Vietnamese food, there are plenty of supermarkets with hot food & pho. (But these are mostly  cafeteria style, asian bento box style set ups, not sit down restaurants.) Thanks Anthony, you were a great host!!"

4967219,67938369,2016-04-01,47960114,Charles,Anthony has well met all my needs for the house and amenities during my stay. The room was cozy. He's also very accessible in terms of communication. Metro transportation nearby his bnb house is so convenient that it well covers the small drawback in terms of location.
4967219,68314959,2016-04-04,32221626,Robbie,A nice convenient place to stay. Only 2 minutes walk from the red line station.
4967219,68732313,2016-04-06,58728196,Magdel,It was very close to the metro station which made exploring Boston very easy. Good communication from Anthony with easy access to room. We enjoyed our stay!
4967219,69257076,2016-04-10,46255820,Bolun,"非常好,由于到的那天晚上凌晨两点才到,结果导航走错了路。温馨提醒各位中国的小伙伴,boston有很多相同的街道名字。最后还好房东不厌其烦的帮助,不然我和我的小伙伴只能睡大街了。房间不错,挺干净,还有小暖气。外面是公用的厨房和浴室,简单但是很干净。再次感谢房东,唯一缺点就是我们住的是靠马路的,早上有点吵。算美中不足吧"
4967219,69658645,2016-04-12,58822215,Ryan,"The room is comfortable, big kitchen, and close to subway."
4967219,70137516,2016-04-16,9038938,Atanas,Very clean. Easy to find. Perfect lacation.
4967219,71205488,2016-04-24,53349149,Connor,Anthony was an excellent host. We had to add an extra day to our trip and he was able to accommodate us without any hassle. Clean apartment with plenty of amenities. Will definitely consider booking again the next time we're in Boston! 
4967219,71403153,2016-04-25,49071614,Daniela,Good
4967219,72271944,2016-05-01,4155193,Rafael & Marie,"We did not have the opportunity to meet Anthony in person but he made sure to provide us with all the information we needed to get to his apartment. He was also available by phone during the whole time of our stay.
The location of his place is ideal as it is located at less than 5 minutes walking distance from the train station. From there you can go everywhere you want in Boston.
The apartment is shared with Anthony's roommates, they are polite and so quiet that you will barely notice they are there.
The bedroom as well as the common areas were perfectly clean.
The bedroom is equipped with a heater that works very well and will keep you warm all night even when the weather is very cold outside.
Our experience was a wonderful one and we would recommend without an hesitation that you stay at Anthony's place!"
4967219,72736975,2016-05-04,67638578,Anton,"The place is located really close to the train station. Besides the room was clean and the self-checkin procedure was very convinient. We haven't met the host, but other roomates were very quiet. However, one should take into account that the place is really close to a highway and the windows aren't noiseproof (and cold-) enough."
4967219,74909053,2016-05-17,53158992,Paul,"Fast response. Room is clean.
There is a portable heater in the room, good for low temperature night.
The house is near T station and convenient, but the traffic noisy sound is a con."
4967219,75116877,2016-05-19,11901559,Serge,"Bon, c etait proche du metro mais c etait trop bruyant avec l autoroute devant. Chambre sans confort ..."
4967219,75466963,2016-05-21,65096759,Thu Thuy,"Although we didn't meet the host personally, he was always available on the phone or email. The listing description was quite accurate. The neighborhood is near the freeway and the red T, which is convenient. However, the noise from the freeway and trains was quite disturbing. It was hard to sleep the first night even though we had ear plugs on. Overall, we had a good time in Boston. Thank you Anthony!
"
4967219,76075033,2016-05-24,61812449,Nayeli,"Although we never met our host the process was smooth and easy. The only difficulty we had at the beginning was parking since it was on a Monday and there are limitations as to where you can park, but he was quick to respond and let us know we could use the driveway. It's also really close to public transportation! "
4967219,76398085,2016-05-27,72115219,翘航,Soooooo convenient place!Only 1 minutes to subway.All the things you need is been prepared well by host.
4967219,76486928,2016-05-27,30631859,K.C.,"Anthony's private room was clean, spacious and really a very convenient one minute walk to the T. We used his place to stay 1 night and travel further via train to NY. We did not meet him, but he helped us out by texting and was fast in his replies. The shower was clean and warm. I talked to his mother or aunt and she was very welcoming.

As it is right next to a freeway, when we did not use the air conditioning, we could hear the constant traffic. Since a family is living there and using the kitchen a lot, I did not feel comfortable to use the kitchen area.

For the low price, it was the perfect place for us to hop through towards NY by train."
4967219,76675041,2016-05-28,53603443,Vivien,Great location. Thank you Anthony for being very accommodating!
4967219,76944477,2016-05-29,62171775,Celia,This was a great little spot for me along with two other friends. We found everything very easily and was very pleased to also have AC on such a nice hot day! Although we never met Anthony he was great at communicating about the room and the acomidations that we needed. Great place to stay for a lovely night in Boston!
4967219,77583690,2016-06-02,9805601,Sven,"Perfect set-up, very spacious room and smooth handling."
4967219,77817936,2016-06-03,62452441,Jing,"The room is very clean and good location, Anthony provides all the help you need. Thank you Anthony!"
4967219,78619242,2016-06-07,62150744,Tomas,"Place was clean and pleasant to stay, (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) were friendly and helpful. Next to subway, only con was continuous noise from nearby traffic, so nothing for light-sleepers."
4967219,78812477,2016-06-09,31403572,Hong,"A nice, clean and convenient place located near by the subway."
4967219,79732898,2016-06-13,40992091,Belén,"Everything was clean, Anthony let us arrive earlier to drop off our bags and was always easy to reach him by phone.
The only con is that the room is next to a highway and it gets really noisy at night. If you are a light sleeper, this place is probably not for you."
4967219,80008310,2016-06-15,14586565,Mathilde,"Anthony a été très arrangeant pour que l'on dépose nos valises avant le check-in. L'appartement est bien situé mais décidément trop bruyant (proximité de l'autoroute).

Anthony allowed us to drop off our luggages before check-in time. His place is very close to the station and the freeway. Convenient but very noise."
4967219,80191301,2016-06-16,61621261,Claire Hyunjung,"Very close to subway(Savin hill). Even you can see the house in subway station and access to downtown in 15 min. No elevator (3rd floor), some noise from nearby highway at night, but clean, cozy room and comfort rbed, fully eqipped, and reasonable price. I couldn't meet Anthony in person, but he was good at arranging the resevation and telling me how to get to the staying from airport. I highly recommend!"
4967219,80493975,2016-06-18,3131401,Suyoung,Easy to communicate with. Family was living next door for extended stay and they were very helpful. Can be a bit scary at night to walk just because it is very quiet. Overall good experience.
4967219,82586455,2016-06-28,76611511,Radim,Very clean and nice place in good location. Easy to find.
4967219,82840627,2016-06-29,62726948,Nessa,"Anthony message me on the day we arrived in Boston and gave direction on how to get to his place. We didn't get to meet each other but he's always available whenever I messaged him. The place was clean and near the train station, which was good for transportation access but at the same time, rather noisy from the trains. It was on the 3rd floor and I wished it was mentioned on the listing because we had big luggages, also the bathroom is shared among 2 other rooms. But overall, good value for the money we spent. "
4967219,83389402,2016-07-02,64043424,Judith,"We only stayed one night in our room. It was comfortable and clean, but unfortunatelly hot."
4967219,84187488,2016-07-05,68139947,Imani,This was our first air BnB experience. The location was perfect being so close to the train station and a quiet area. The room looked just like the photo so you're definitely getting what you see. Anthony was very responsive and accommodating.
